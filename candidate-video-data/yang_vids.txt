[Applause] [Music] [Applause] and Thank You yang gang I love campaigning in Iowa because this is one of the only places in the entire country where democracy still works as it is intended [Applause] you know this but I don't know if you realize just how much power is in this room tonight I did the math Iowa do you 
know how many Californians each of you is worth one thousand Californians each when I look around this arena tonight I do not just see 14,000 Iowans I see 14 million Californians that is a power in this room the power to change the course of history that's why it is that thrilled to be back here and a privilege to address you all now why would presidential candidate yes but I'm also a parent and a dad how many of you all our parents yeah my wife 
Evelyn is here with us tonight we have two young boys Christopher and Damian and I'm running for president because of a thought that the parents here in this room have had but we've been afraid to express and it is this our kids are not alright they are not alright because we have left them a future far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents now many of you think of me as a business guy but for the last seven years I've been a non profit guy I 
started a nonprofit called venture for America that helped create thousands of jobs and cities like Detroit Cleveland st. Louis Baltimore and you know I saw during these seven years I saw millions of young people who are not starting families let alone businesses because they couldn't pay their bills I saw millions of young people who were buried under a mountain of debt and trapped in their parents basements 
I saw record high levels of anxiety stress depression mental illness even suicides and drug overdoses to the point that our country's life expectancy has declined for three years in a row first time in a hundred years that has happened if you turn down cable news today why would you think that Donald Trump is our president go ahead and shout something out someone who's not the yang guy Russia racism Facebook Hillary Clinton 
emails all mixed together but I believe many of you know different I'm a numbers guy and the reason why Donald Trump is our president the reason why he won your state by eight points is that we blasted away 40,000 manufacturing jobs right here in Iowa and you saw all of those towns go from blue to red as it happened and that did not just happen here in Iowa we did it in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Missouri all of 
the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win we blasted away four million manufacturing jobs and unfortunately we are not stopping there Iowa how many of you have seen stores close where you work and live here in the state raise our hands and why are those stores closing it's a one-word answer amazon that's right Amazon soaking up 20 billion dollars in business every year causing 30% of your stores and malls to 
close how much did Amazon pay in federal taxes last year that is your math Iowa 20 billion out zero back 30% of your stores and malls closed the most common job in your state is retail clerk 39 year-old woman making between nine and ten dollars an hour when her store closes what is her next move going to be I am a numbers guy but you don't need the numbers you just look around your communities you see it when you walk 
into the CVI and the grocery store and you see the self-serve kiosk you see our neighbors kids addicted to drugs you see the headlines where Google and uber are working on trucks that can drive themselves these are the real problems that got Donald Trump elected the fact that more and more of us are feeling left behind experts are calling this economic transformation this period the fourth Industrial Revolution when is the 
last time you heard a politician even read the words fourth Industrial Revolution just now right and I am barely a politician these are the problems that god Donald Trump elected and this is what you must solve this is how you must use your power now I want you all to ask yourselves for a moment how was a man you've never heard of eight months ago speaking after Joe Biden and before Elizabeth Warren how did a man you never heard of before 
raise ten million dollars last quarter in increments of only $30 each so my fans are almost as cheap as Bernie's it is because I know what the true nature of the problems are and how we can solve them and it is up to you to take these solutions to the rest of the country to present a new way forward as fast as possible now what is this new way forward what is the vision if you've heard anything about me and my campaign 
heard this there's an Asian man running for president who wants to give everyone one thousand dollars a month and the first time you heard that it sounded like a gimmick too good to be true but this is not my idea and it's not a new idea Thomas Paine was floored at our founding Martin Luther King fought for it in the 60s a thousand economists endorsed it Congress the US House of Representatives passed it twice in 1971 and 11 years later one state passed a 
dividend right now everyone in that state gets between one and two thousand dollars a year no questions asked and what state is that and how does Alaska pay for it and what is the oil of the 21st century Iowa technology software self-driving cars and trucks our data is now worth more than oil raise your hand if you got your data check in the mail where did the data checks go they went to Facebook Amazon Google and the trillion-dollar tech companies that are 
paying zero or near zero and now think about what does what $1,000 a month would actually mean in your hands in the hands of your friends and neighbors it would mean lower stress levels it would mean fewer arguments with your spouse it would mean being able to tire with dignity it would mean not having to choose between car repairs and new clothes for your kids it's not about the money it is about what it means to us and I've been giving a thousand dollars 
a month to families around the country for a number of months now I recommend it and one of them is here tonight Kyle Christensen who lives in Iowa Falls Thank You Kyle look at that I thought you were up there Kyle I'm glad you're at the fancy table so Kyle lives in Iowa Falls with his mom who's recovering from cancer and when I saw Kyle the my last trip he said that after he'd taken care of some bills 
he bought a guitar and was playing shows for the first time in years poor Kyle was a guitar for Jody in New Hampshire was car repairs to visit her daughter from Mallory in Florida it was going back to school at the age of 68 this is what the freedom dividend would mean for us in real life and this is the vision that you can make a reality like this Iowa because this is this is the your power and your power alone now my first move my first goal was not 
to run for president of the United States because I am not insane I worked in the Obama administration I went to Washington DC and I said what are we going to do to help our fellow citizens understand that it is not immigrants that are causing these problems it is technology and an economy that is pushing more and more of us to decide and the folks in Washington DC had very little to offer but one of them gave me some guidance that led me here to you 
all tonight he said Andrew during the wrong town no one in Washington DC will touch this because fundamentally this is not a town of leaders this is a town of followers and the only way we will do anything is if you were to create a wave in the rest of the country and bring that wave crashing down on our heads and that is why I'm with you tonight Iowa I am with you tonight because you must be that way I am not running for president because I 
fantasize about being president I am running for president because like so many of you in this room I'm a parent and I'm a patriot I have seen the future that lies ahead for our children and it is not something I am willing to accept here in Iowa you actually know what the future holds if you look up you saw it happen to your farms and then your factories now it's on your Main streets soon it will hit your highways it is up to you and you alone to turn the tide 
you must be the wave that helps us rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy to work for us to work for you the people of this country [Music] you must be the wave that helps give the entire nation a new way forward and gives me and millions of parents around the country the ability to look our children in the eyes and say with truth in our hearts your country loves you your country values you and you are 
going to be alright thank you very much Iowa let's make history let's move the country forward together in 2020 and win this whole thing I love Iowa I love it here [Applause] [Music] [Music] you 
[Applause] Northern Virginia Wow people here in the front I want you to turn around and see what I see [Music] there is so much beautiful humanity in this room tonight Virginia and we are going to I love you too we are going to make history in 2020 you can see it I just came back from I well how many of you saw the Iowa speech oh that was so much fun you go out there's 
a smoke machine I need to find one of those but we came out of there and then the best part in addition to the journalists saying to the team on the sites like I'm not allowed to say this but your man gave the speech of the night but the best part is we leave that night we campaign and I over the next day and the crowds are bigger the Energy's higher and at every stop people were like I saw you on Friday night and I had to come find you 
so we just touched down in Virginia because you all are about to pick up the baton you've got this incredibly important election day tomorrow in Virginia Virginia is on the precipice Virginia is going very very purple and with just a bit of a push I think Virginia is going to go blue what do you do [Applause] maybe man yang Yang blue 
I want to give a shout out to Dylan who was on the stage and is recovering he's right there and he's doing great let's hit I also got what I give a hand of Matic AJ Steve and the rest of the incredible activists and leaders of the yang gang here in Virginia that have brought us together that is going to make tomorrow a huge day for the campaign in the yang game really all for you I want to get a sense of this heart of you all are 
actually G mu student something I have done the math [Applause] about 40% of your OGM you students that seems like a lot of you have seen me speak in some context before watched a YouTube video raise your hand if you've seen me speak before it's like the rest of you the rest you didn't have your hands up you're what I call yank curious and jump on in the water's fine so I'm going to go through what got me into the 
race in the first place most of you know this about me I was certainly not someone who was brought up to think I was ever going to run for president no that was not the conversation in the yang household and I I have the fashion choices to prove it now like so many of you who are students here I was told my job was to try and do well in school and I get the sense that many of you are like me either first or second generation born in this country to the 
country it's like get good grades make your way get credentialed and so I tried to do that I went to law school some of you I can sense are going to go to law school I'm not sure if that's applause worthy honestly spent five unhappy months as a corporate lawyer and then I'd love to try and start a business and I'll tell you starting a business the hardest thing you ever have to do it's up there with having a kid those two are the 
hardest things I've ever done running for president probably up there too though I gotta say running for president is getting easier and easier because we're gonna win this whole thing so I start a business had failure and in some success and in 2009 I was shaken by the financial crisis and what was transpiring around the country and I thought I had some insight as to why this had happened Virginia I thought that so many of the 
wannabe whiz kids I'd gone to college in law school with had gone to Wall Street and dreamt up these exotic financial instruments that had crashed the economy and I said wow what a disaster what a train wreck and so the question is what the heck can you do that's better than that I said well I think I know something I would love for people to head to places like Detroit and Cleveland and Birmingham and businesses and do something productive that people 
would be excited about that you'd be excited about because right now we're pushing you in certain directions and not others so I spent seven years traveling the country as the head of a non-profit I'd start adventure for America got honored by the Obama administration so I got to meet the president I was blown away by the disparities between some parts of this country and others I have the sense of many of you 
are students here many of you probably grew up in this part of the country how many of you only group of the Midwest I'm on the South West Coast DC metro area northeast like me so I spent seven years working in the Midwest in the south and I was staggered by the gulf between Michigan and Manhattan or st. Louis in San Francisco where you make that trip you feel like you're crossing dimensions or decades or ways of life and not just a few time zones but I was 
still stunned what Donald Trump became our president in 2016 [Music] and tepee this was a giant red flag and you watch cable news why would you think Donald Trump's our president today Russia racism Facebook the FBI Hillary Clinton emails all mashed together into some kind of bizarre stew that is what's being sold to you on cable news but I'm a numbers guy Virginia 
[Music] [Applause] reason why Donald Trump won is that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs that were in Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania Missouri Wisconsin and Iowa where I just left and when a factory closes blue goes to red in an awful hurry there's a straight line up between the adoption of industrial automation and a voting area and their movement to trump and unfortunately 
we're not going to stop there how many of you have noticed stores and malls closing your hometowns and where you live and why are those stores closing that's right Amazon I'm soaking up 20 billion dollars in business every single year they do it like this - and make their hand into a claw like this 20 billion zero back the average retail clerk whose store in malls closing a 30 is a 39 year old woman making between nine and ten dollars now what is her 
next move when the store closes when the mall closes when you want to call the customer service line of a big company you do the same thing I do which is what you dial zero zero zero human human human se representative representative until we get something online right there Hannah that's what you do oh yeah we all do it because that that software is miserable you're like oh you know they gave me a human butt in two or three short years the software is gonna 
sound like this hey Andrew how's it going what can I do for you it'll be seamless efficient a little bit sexy perhaps what is that gonna mean for the two and a half million Americans who work in call centers right now making $14 an hour how many of you seen a self-serve kiosk in a fast-food restaurant McDonald's they're gonna be in every location in the United States by 2021 at McDonald's and the other chancing in a 
follow suit it's going to start at the front of that house and move to the back of the house being in food service or food preps the third most common job in our country most common job in 29 states is driving a truck I'm gonna be all Noah truck driver I know they know Fred [Music] [Applause] those you don't know friends a truck driver who let me ride in his truck and now he has my face on his truck 
you know 50 feet long and 30 feet high first time I saw it was going the site fred is excited about the campaign because he realizes that we're in the process of trying to automate his job in the jobs of the three and a half million truckers in this country my friends in California are working on self-driving trucks right now they tell me they are 98% of the way there and the way they think they can get the last 2% is by equipping the trucks with Bhaiji enable 
tella operating equipment where when the trucks not sure what to do a human operator will beam in from Nevada or Arizona and drive it like a video game that's how they thinking in the last two percent a hundred sixty eight billion dollars a year Virginia is what's at stake that's enough money to do incredible things that's why some of my friends some of the smartest people in the country are working on it right now what's that going to mean for Fred in 
the three and a half million truckers in this country or the seven million Americans who work at truckstops motels and diners that rely upon the truck stopping every day the Democrats are acting like Donald Trump is the source of all of our problems he is not he is a symptom he's a manifestation of the fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history what experts are calling the fourth 
Industrial Revolution when is the last time you heard a politician even say the words fourth Industrial Revolution just now and I am barely a politician we're gonna win oh my confess my first group was not to run for president I came here to the DC area and I met with various leaders and I said what are we going to do to help our fellow Americans understand it is not immigrants that are causing these problems did you go to the factory at 
Michigan or Ohio it is not wall-to-wall immigrants it's wall to wall robot arms and machines same thing in the Amazon Fulfillment Center and I'm going to rip just a little bit I have some insight Jeff Bezos believes there is one threat to Amazon and that threat is the US government not coincidentally h22 here in the DC metro area he just glued a couple penthouses together and said one was not enough I need to glue them together 
no bought the washington post with a pocket change in his sofa of course heaven this is what's at stake they look around and they see hey we're paying zero in taxes right now we kind of like them you know when the accountants come in at the end of the year and say hey Jeff great news your taxes again and then just like great and then what does Jeff do Jeff goes into this vault takes out bags of gold coins gives them to each 
accountant and then they go home and take a little Scrooge McDuck gold coin back it's like their annual ritual Virginia is it their fault that they're paying zero in taxes nobody's on our fault that we're gonna put a stop to it am i right we are going to rewrite the rules of the 21st century economy so that they work for us they work for you and for the young people in particular hearing this audience if you have the sinking feeling 
that we have left you a god-awful mess we have it should be a source of national shame what a shambles we have left you it's true you look up and you're like okay how did college get so freakin expensive I got two and a half times more expensive than when I went and he does not gotten two and a half times better [Music] [Applause] it is a symptom of the disease the 
disease where everything revolves around the almighty dollar in this country and it's turning us all into these rats in a maze we're like scrambling around trying to justify our own market value and it is time to dispel this confusion in America that economic value and human value are the same things and this is what the traitors against each other in destroy us because in the era of artificial intelligence it doesn't matter if the trucker was hardworking 
and conscientious or not the robot truck is going to zoom past him all the same and it's not just the truckers it's the radiologists as the pharmacists it's the lawyers I did that job long enough to know that you can automate a lot of that job oh you laugh that's one reason when you're saying go to law school and if you look into it hey I can edit contracts faster more efficiently more inexpensively than the best human lawyer at this point oh it's true 
and so the meritocracy that you have been sold young people in particular is crumbling around you and you sense this you sense that you're being fed a bill of goods that there's like this ladder up for the ladder just gets more and more expensive and you're not sure it's going to lead to what's been promised this is what we have to fix but we cannot do without your help as an adult I am ashamed of what we have left you oh you better I'm a parent and 
I'm ashamed of the world we are leaving to our kids this is why I'm running for president Virginia [Applause] we have to let our fellow Americans know what the real problems are so that we can solve them Donald Trump getting him out of office will not make all of these problems go away artificial intelligence is still going to get faster and smarter the robot trucks are going to come closer to the 
highways Amazon will still be paying a zero in taxes we have to rewrite the rules they work for us they work for you particularly the young people now if you're here in this room you know I love thinking about this the first time you heard it that there's an Asian man running for president wants to give everyone $1,000 a month and I do and best of all with your help I will and the first time you heard it it sounded like a gimmick or a joke but 
this is not my idea then it is not a new idea Thomas Paine was forward at the founding of our country Martin Luther King fought for it in the 60s and it is what he was fighting for when he was killed in 1968 a thousand economists endorsed it in the 60s past the US House of Representatives twice in 1971 under Nixon of all people came this close to being laws called a Family Assistance Plan and I talked to some of the democratic politics the 
reason it passed the house and not the Senate was that Democrats in the Senate wanted an even higher income threshold and someone who worked in democratic politics at that time told me was the biggest screwup that they'd ever made and if they'd just taken that deal every family united states have been guaranteed a certain level of income from 1971 till today can you imagine if they had made that move then 11 years later once they did pass the dividend 
where everyone in that state now gets between one and two thousand dollars a year no questions asked and what state is that what is the oil of the 21st century technology AI self-driving cars and trucks a study just came out that said that our data is now worth more than oil where is all that digne money going it was on Facebook in the trillion-dollar tech companies that pay zero or near zero in taxes and I am just like you 
when you see that Lauren weird legal agreement with I agree or I can send at the bottom we all just scroll through that thing and hit the button I have a law degree and I'm not reading that shit [Music] it's a pretend choice not I mean they're like pretending you made an active affirmative decision you did not what we have done is we have forfeited our day to them to the mega tech companies for these free fantastic services but the 
deal is going darker and darker around us it is you know it seem like too good to be true turns out it was too good to be true because now they are selling and reselling of repackaging our data over and over again profiting to the tune of tens of billions of dollars and we are seeing none of it all that happens to us is that occasionally we get a message saying hey you might want to change your password and you're like I'm appealing 
you're telling me this because something is gone wrong not so bad but probably change it am I gonna change it like yeah what's the worst that could happen I need my data again stolen like it'll be okay you know but even worse it's actually corroding our democracy our sense of agency or decision-making I have to say it's embarrassing that Mark Zuckerberg is clinging to the like oh oh we can't decide what's true what's not 
true too [Music] [Applause] I have a feeling if Facebook was making money on it they would figure it out do you agree freaking embarrassing this freedom dividend that seems so fantastic initially it's actually common sense and inevitable at a time of unprecedented economic change because after I'm your president and we passed this dividend where will the money go in real life how 
are you going to spend it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so when I heard school loans music car repairs how much of it would stay where you live and work and go to school most of it not all of it you would upgrade the nipple you'd get your own Netflix password really you'd stop passing 
around your friends to the point where some of you would get locked out periodically and then you're like oh this is irritating I guess eight of us are using it at the same time so now pose freedom dividend you would get your own it'll be a glorious day it's gonna go right into daycare and car repairs and Little League signups and student loans and my textbooks and everything else this is the triple up economy Virginia from you all your people your 
families and your communities up this is the opposite of the trickle-down garbage that's been weakening us for years [Applause] [Applause] to [Applause] and this is the vision this is the mission this is what we're going to make real in the days to come my campaign just raised ten million dollars last quarter cheapest Bernie's I love you for 
it this is very cheap wholesome gang to join alright we just got some gang members who were supporting bitch Oh - and I appreciate the heck out of everyone who supported better than and when we put up that ten million dollar number Virginia there was a tremor in the political world they said what just happened how the heck did the Andrew yang no one had ever heard of but eight months ago just put out ten million dollars and the way we did it is that 
the people of this country you all are a sleeping giant you know and this campaign is the smelling salts Virginia [Music] they're gonna wake the people up one by one and they're gonna look up and they're gonna say wait a minute we can do that and we're in a democracy we are the owners and shareholders of this country if enough of us get together and say we want an economy that works for us in the 21st century it will become 
reality like that then is not just the fact that there's money in our hands would make us healthier mentally healthier less stressed out would improve our relationships would improve our decision-making would improve our graduation rates would decrease domestic violence would decrease hospital visits and not it's not just all of those things it's that our very goals as a society have to move forward as well right now how are we measuring our 
economic and social progress yes yeah and how many of you are excited about GDP when you woke up this morning really do we move GDP and I love it instead of GDP we should be using your health your deathblows your mental health and freedom from substance abuse [Applause] with living in a country where I walk into a convenience store and I see a senior citizen working himself or herself to the bone because there is no 
other way to survive that person should be someplace enjoying their golden years and that should be a teenager in that convenience store working for beer money [Applause] we have to actually change the goals of our economy and as your president I will update this archaic century-old GDP number that's writing us off a cliff that's driving us off a cliff and replace it with an American scorecard with the real measurements that I will 
present to you all and all of our fellow Americans every year at the State of the Union [Applause] coin duck I'm kind of old school I still use popcorn said it was crazy if you like the idea of a president presenting that information to at the State of the Union every year yes then you're definitely yeah [Applause] 
I want to talk a little bit about how we win like you come out tonight we're gonna have a fun rallying under the science of things but the way we win the way I have succeeded in light is by paying attention to the key variables that actually drive success and tonight that is actually not what I'm talking about that is what the people in front of me were talking about we need people here if you're registered or both go ahead and yell if you're 
registered to vote and if you're not you should definitely pretend they're registered to vote we need you to make sure and sign a clipboard before you leave here tonight can you do that for me a signature is that will get us closer to this goal of 5,000 on yellow say the way it works is that the Secretary of State they're kind of sticklers about this stuff so what they do is they try and find reasons to reject signatures so the requirement is 
5,000 but if you want to be saved you've got to put up 7,000 8,000 9,000 to 10,000 because they did they're jerks then you're like hey we're still over 5,000 so shut up so right now 3,000 we need to clear eight nine ten thousand and we need your help to do so being an entrepreneur being an operator it's not about branding the hype it's about making sure you actually succeed at the ground level so one of the reasons why I'm proudest 
at this campaign because of all the smoke all of the incredible success you know it gets me most excited is when I get to call someone and tell them that they are getting $1,000 a month for a year let's call the entire country am i right so one of you to translate this vision into action we need you to make sure it's sign a petition and then if you want to go the extra mile and be a superhero on a chimp we need you to go 
both tomorrow but then when you vote bring a clipboard with you and just say hey you want to sign this petition to get Andrew young on the ballot in Virginia you get a few dozen people we get enough of you to do that I mean we're gonna be done like that [Applause] look out a native 200 of you get 50 that's 10,000 we're done do you wanna help us finish this off Virginia and this is the same where we'll be when 
I'm your president one thing that I dislike about being president is it seems like a lot of it's about how you make people feel which is cool Feliz are good but then it's also trying to get down to the roots of the problem of the guts and see if you can improve people's lives beyond the feeling in terms of their mental health one of my dreams as your president is to be able to go and actually just given to the guts and solve the problems I want to get out of 
the White House a lot when you're president and not in like this Air Force one Caravan and do some kind of nuts it's like higher I just won't like show up the things help figure out problems and then take some of the best resources in our society and help solve those problems for us the American people that is the vision [Applause] we don't have the money it's such nonsense we're at 21 trillion dollars a 
year the richest most advanced economy in the history of the world do I remember voting for the four trillion dollar bailout of Wall Street remember anyone complaining please we can get the money but then when it's our turn oh they're like oh no we're broke were broke oh no we are now broke we the opposite of broke [Applause] the country country not bro and I remember the reason why I quit my 
job to start a non-profit after the financial crisis I saw what we did we had a choice between the banks and our people who are losing their homes and we chose the banks and I said that was the wrong choice this time we're going to choose our people way forward and I want to walk you through because some of you are here you're getting curious you're like who it's guys interesting can he win oh I can win 
the number one criteria for Democrats in this primary is beating Donald Trump [Applause] [Applause] you dig in you find that there's one candidate that's drawing in libertarians [Applause] independence and even disaffected Donald Trump voters we could build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump in 2020 there is one poll I came out that said that I am one of only two 
candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters would support in the general election Bob is an avid Fox water she said that the only Democrat I would support is that yang fellow because he does not seem to judge me at all and it's true I just want to solve her problems I just want to solve all of our problems we can come together I can help bring a fractured country together because 
people sense I just want to move us forward it's not left it's not right [Applause] Virginia [Applause] make America take harder am I going to come right here back to Northern Virginia next year as your president [Applause] to make it to you all to your kids and make history together in this election 
in 2020 I love you all [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] put the money in for him the money in our hand the money our hand put them on our head put the money in our head yeah 
put the money in our hands the money in our head put the money in our head can we afford it cause inflation is it awesome yeah anyone trying to make it happen [Music] 
and she didn't change her life although oh my gosh incredible to be here I want I want you to reflect a little bit how on what brought you here tonight because I was thinking about what brought me here tonight and the Democratic Party of the United States of America is the greatest hope and force for progress in our country today and and you all are going to determine its future it is not an exaggeration at all to say that the 
future of the country rests in your hands and thank you all the incredible work that you do leading us every day and fighting the fight I know it's been hard this last couple of years but help is on the way now I'm not from here as you may may have gathered my parents immigrated to this country in the 1960s they met at graduate school I was born in a town called Stu connected in New York my 
father worked for GE and then IBM my father's a physicists my mother's an artists my brother's a psychology professor and I became an entrepreneur and CEO I built an education company that was sold to a public company in 2009 and I looked at the nation's problems at that point I made a little money and so I thought to myself well what are the biggest problems that I see and the biggest problems that I saw were that so much money and energy and talent 
was heading to the coasts and not to places like Iowa including people who were from places like Iowa many many times they thought they had to leave for better opportunities and so that was the problem that I saw and I said we can do something about that so I donated 120,000 my own money he started calling rich friends and said do you love America and then the savvy among them said what does it mean if I say yes to that question 
and then I said at least $10,000 and then enough of them said I love America where we launched with a budget of about a quarter million today our budgets about 25 times larger thousands of young people have joined MIT or applied to venture for America and hundreds have headed to cities around the country to help create businesses and help businesses grow so that's what I've been up to for the last seven years I'm an entrepreneur and a problem solver who 
likes math and I say that because people have told me that the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math now I'm here tonight to tell you all a story in numbers in part and I'm going to answer a question that you have been grappling with for the last two years and it may be perhaps the most important question of our time and that question is this why did Donald Trump win in Iowa by nearly 10 points in 2016 for that matter why did he win Michigan why did 
he win Ohio why did he win Pennsylvania why did he win Missouri why did he even win Wisconsin now that is the question of our time and the answer is in the numbers because again I love numbers so I dug in and the most direct correlation I found was that the more manufacturing jobs were lost in a voting district due to automation the more blue turned to red in that district the reason why Donald Trump is our president today is that we've 
automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Missouri Wisconsin and nearly 40,000 right here in Iowa how many of you personally know someone who has lost his or her job in manufacturing over the last number of years I'm sure a number of you do and I've been in the in these communities in the aftermath of the plant closing I heard from Mitch right here an old wine in Northeast Iowa what happened there when jobs disappeared 
that's when despair takes its place and that's when blue turns to red so I have some bad news I was just in Silicon Valley last month and this is going to get worse before it gets better the engineers and scientists of Silicon Valley are working on solving the problems of today the business problems of today but as they succeed in solving these problems their solutions are not going to improve your lives or our lives together what they're going to do is 
they're going to make human labor your labor our labor less and less central to the economy and more and more obsolete now this may seem far-fetched are futuristic to someone you but it's the hard truth and if you look around you Iowa has lost 12,000 retail jobs since 2001 how many of you have noticed store is closing in your neighborhoods or area there are another one hundred seventy eight thousand hard-working Iowans and 
retail and trade right now and three of your seventeen malls are in danger of closing this is going to get worse there are another over 30,000 Iowans who drive a truck for a living and this is the most common job in 29 states my friends in Silicon Valley and I am friends with some of them please don't hold against me but my friends in Silicon Valley are working on trucks that can drive themselves they say that there are 98% of the way there and these trucks will 
start hitting the highways in five to ten years so the question is what's going to happen to the drivers at that point there are thousands of call center workers in Iowa how many of you saw that Google recently demonstrated software that can do the job of a call center worker someone's not in here how many of you saw that well you can google it you know and it's there but these changes are real artificial intelligence is real autonomous vehicles are real this is the 
greatest economic and technological transition in the history of mankind Donald Trump is the manifestation of this transition and our government has been decades behind in being honest about it and addressing it now before I deciding to run for president I decided to try and talk to various political leaders about the fact that this is the core set of issues and what do you think their responses to me were go ahead and shout them out was it 
be fun sorry go ahead wha-wha it sounds like you were in the room so the the solutions I heard were these one we cannot talk about that too we should study that further and three we must educate and retrain Americans for the jobs of the future now that third one sounds great I'm a Democrat I love education I love retraining but again I looked at the numbers and we know what happens in 
the aftermath of losing these manufacturing jobs that only less than 10 percent of manufacturing workers qualified for federally funded retraining programs and if they did participate the success rate was less than 20 percent we know that almost half of manufacturing workers that lost their jobs left the workforce and did not work again and that nearly 1/4 of manufacturing jobs that lost their jobs left the workforce and never worked 
again so those are the numbers that is the story the numbers are telling us and this is the challenge of our era now the question is what are we going to do about it the problem is this big and the answer is as John alluded to we must fundamentally shift the way we perceive work and value in our society and I have a three-part plan to make this happen and solve for the greatest issue that threatens our way of life today now the first is the freedom dividend where 
every American adult would receive $1,000 free and clear no questions asked every month to pay your bills invest in your families start new businesses and do what you want to do because you know how best you would use that money already right now 31% of Iowans are working full time and cannot make ends meet and 59% of our fellow Americans cannot pay an unexpected $500 bill they are living paycheck to paycheck week to week and you know that is the reality 
for many of your friends and neighbors and we can change that we can give Americans a raise so that so many of you might think wow that sounds phenomenal too good to be true but I want to give you some background in history a law almost exactly like this past the of Representatives in 1971 under Richard Nixon Martin Luther King was for it a thousand economists signed a letter saying this would be great for the economy and society and a plan just like 
this has been in effect in one state for 36 years where it has created thousands of jobs helped improve children's nutrition and lowered income inequality and what state is that you may or man I know yeah it's on Alaska and they use oil money and I'm going to ask you all today Democrats of Iowa what is the oil of today technology that's right that is the oil of today so my plan the freedom dividend would put 16 billion dollars into the hands of Iowans every year so 
that you could pay your bills and do everything that you would do with a thousand dollars more per month and would create over 40,000 jobs in Iowa immediately now this is a very very big plan and a big move but it's something that we can achieve because again you determine the future of this country and we need to build an economy that actually puts human goals and values front and center invest in our people and build a trickle up economy the 
Republicans have been selling that triple down trickle down garbage for decades and we know it doesn't work at all they even know it doesn't work they know it's nonsense so we're going to build a trickle up economy from our from our people up our families up and our communities up and that's the first big move I'll make as president the second is that we need to get healthcare costs off 
the backs of American families and businesses I've been an entrepreneur and CEO and I know it's harder to expand your business it's harder to hire it's harder to start a business it's even harder to switch jobs we spent twice as much as other industrialized countries on our healthcare than other countries because our system rewards activity and not healthfulness and as president I will move us towards Medicare for all and get the incentives right and the 
third thing is that we have to change the way we measure progress in our economy GDP is something we invented less than a hundred years ago during the Great Depression and even the inventor said this is a terrible measurement for national well-being so of course what do we do we start using it as a measurement for national well-being it's a smart man he's smarter than the people that have been using it now I'm running for president right now and my wife is 
working much harder than I am and those of you who have kids at home raise your hand if you have kids at home most of you got to be more parents than that my wife is at home with our young boys who were five and two one of whom has special needs and she's working much much harder than I do what does GDP value her work at right now zero and we all know that's nonsense we know that she's contributing much more value than the average hedge fund 
investor or a Silicon Valley programmer we need to we need to shift to new measurements for our economic progress things that matter to us like childhood success rates mental health and freedom from substance abuse environmental quality median income and wealth proportion of elderly in quality care that can actually retire with dignity these are the measurements that would actually tell us how we're doing and as president and I will 
establish the American scorecard and present on how we are doing every year at the State of the Union so these are the three big ideas to get us through the greatest economic shift in human history and I'm going to close with a conversation I had in Washington DC that will be familiar to some of you so I was going through these issues and saying look this is a giant technology shift and the American people are being devastated through no fault of their own 
what are we going to do about it and this is what someone said to me he said to me you are in the wrong town that this town is not a town of leaders this is a town of laggards and followers we will be the last people to figure this out and what you must do Andrew is you must create a wave in other parts of the country and bring it crashing down on our heads and only then will we understand and that is why I'm with you 
here tonight Democrats of Iowa I need your help to create this wave to build an economy from the ground up to show that we still in the democracy and that America needs your leadership right now America needs your leadership your courage your vision your compassion your faith in your fellowship to light the way now I've got to say that I've been looking forward to this this occasion for a long time because I know the power 
you have in your hands even though you don't always feel it day to day because you are fighting the fight but I'm going to tell you that you are some of the most powerful people in this country and that we are all going to come to you and ask you for your support and that's what I'm doing here tonight but together if we work our hearts out we can show our fellow Americans that we still live in a democracy that people matter more than money that our values are more powerful 
than any lobbyists and that we put everything we have into it we can still build a country that we are proud of to leave for our children thank you very much Democrats in Iowa for a night god bless you all god bless the United States of America thank you all you 
he is running Democratic primary for president he's an entrepreneur founder of venture for America and one of the first to say yes let me come and speak to the National Action Network and we want to hear from him mr. Andrew Lane give him a hand holy cow is it a privilege and honor to be here with you all today I I just followed Eric Holder and I have to say that guy was seriously thinking about running for president am I not am I is like yeah you heard that 
you heard that I also also let's give Reverend Sharpton a round of applause for what he has built he does not remember this but he and I met several more like at more than a decade ago in holy cow has he lost a lot of weight since then and you know what that he has - holy cow alone yes yes leaving the cow alone will do that but in a word you know what that is my friends that is longevity longevity is a beautiful thing so it's a privilege and 
honor to be here with you all because of what you represent and you represent obviously 12 candidates will be here with you all because we all know that african-american voters and leaders have helped choose the next president in many of the last cycles but you all represent something even more profound than that you represent moral leadership and moral authority in this country now you got that the hardest way possible you got that through the historic 
subjugation and oppression and marginalization of African Americans from day one or day - a hundred years and better yet you all are fighting for a better future that's how you get moral authority now you have this moral authority that most politicians will never have most Americans will never sniff and as someone who's running for president now I would acknowledge that very very plainly I grew up a skinny asian kid in an all-white suburb in New 
York so I had that experience but I know that that experience is the palest shadow of what most African Americans experienced growing up and coming of age in this country because while I had words working against me you have something much more cruel you have numbers working against you and you all know what the numbers are now I have about nine minutes with you all I'm gonna do three things in this nine minutes the first thing is gonna sound 
impossible the first thing is I'm going to convince you that things are even worse than you think they are now you're all listening to this being like no way he's gonna be able to pull that off but I'm gonna pull it off the second thing is I'm going to present a way forward and the third is I'm going to let you know that the country needs you all more than ever right now so how am I going to tell you all the things we've been worse than you think there 
are I'm a numbers guy I'm a math guy and the numbers are cruel so the numbers that you know of African American median net worth is a small fraction of the national average you all know that you all know that african-americans are almost six times more likely to be incarcerated than other groups you all know that but this is something that most of you do not know that according to a study that was published in The Guardian a number of months ago median 
African American net worth is projected to go to zero by 2050 334 years from now now you might be looking at yourselves being like how is that possible how could the median African American net worth be projected to go to zero over the next thirty four years and I'm here to tell you exactly how that's going to happen right now the dynamics of this winner-take-all economy are about to take off I have many friends in Silicon Valley and what we know is that capital 
and technology are about to converge in historic ways and assume more and more economic value now the five most common jobs in the economy are this administrative and clerical work retail work food service and food prep truck driving and transportation and manufacturing now many of those jobs have historically been filled by African Americans and many of those jobs are going to disappear in the days to come how many of you saw the Google AI demo 
where that AI did the job of a call center worker anyway we see that what do you think the time frame is on AI being able to do the job of an average call center worker who right now makes $14 an hour few years that's right 30% of American malls and stores are closing in the next number of years four years and why are they closing Amazon that's right Amazon is vacuuming up twenty billion dollars a year in commerce pushing Main Street 
stores and malls into oblivion and you know that working in retail is the most common job in the economy the average retail worker is a 39 year old woman making between 10 and $11 an hour and we know she does not have much savings what's her move going to be when those malls and stores closed how much did Amazon pay in federal taxes last year zero that's right they're this giant vacuum cleaners sucking the vitality out of your neighborhoods and 
communities and you're getting zero back this is the buzzsaw this is capital and technology converging in historic ways this is going to be an economic natural disaster or unnatural disaster if you want to look at it that way and who loses in a natural disaster you do communities of color people with lower resources people with lower access to capital and Technology are going to be the big losers all right have I convinced you that things are even worse 
than you think fantastic job number one the hard part done now number two how the heck are we going to get out of this what is the path forward so as usual you look to the wisdom of dr. Martin Luther King jr. so Martin Luther King whose birthday we celebrate every year what was he championing in 1967 he was championing something called a guaranteed minimum income he said look we have to just guarantee Americans a certain amount of 
money every year and he said something some wonder what Eric Holder just said he said we need to team up with the impoverished and the exploited and the displaced of every class every category to try and make this happen because it's going to be a brutal fight and he was so right that he was killed the next year but if you read his book chaos our community in 1967 this is what he was championing and he was not alone Thomas Paine was for this at the founding of 
the country Milton Friedman and a thousand economists signed a study saying this would be great for America it came this close to being law in 1971 it passed the House of Representatives twice and then 11 years later one state passed a dividend where now everyone in that state gets between one and two thousand dollars a year no questions and what state is that Alaska yeah most of you are like Alaska like what Alaska and how do they fund it oil and what is 
the oil of the 21st century technology data AI self-driving cars and trucks what they did for the people of Alaska with oil we will do for you in all Americans with technology money this is the path forward now if you've heard anything about me you've heard that there's an Asian man running for president wants to give everyone $1,000 a month and all of those things are true but think about what $1,000 a month would mean for everyone in your families 
and communities it would mean children have a better chance to learn have better nutrition it would mean physical health would improve mental health would improve domestic violence Goes Down would this improve criminal justice yes it would I would suggest it would would it give people better access to voting rights and access to legal resources yes it would but most profoundly how many of you all are parents I'm a parent most 
profoundly imagine beyond the look your teenage son or daughter in the in the eye and say starting at age 18 you will receive $1,000 a month from your country because your country loves you your country values you and you are just as American as everyone else that is profound right now what are we saying to our young people we're saying you can vote maybe and then they look up they see the system with pipes clogged full of money hundreds of millions of dollars 
and they despair they say is my vote meaningful is it going to be enough to turn the tide and that's where number three comes in which is where you all come in so I am championing the freedom dividend the trickle up economy from our people our families and our communities up a community that works for us sorry an economy that works for us and an economy where instead of us serving the numbers the numbers serve us now that is the vision of the economy that this 
country needs and needs it very very bad this country does not understand what is happening we're in the third inning of the greatest economic and technological transformation in the history of our country and who are we blaming immigrants it's ridiculous it's stupid and what we have to do is we have to wake up our fellow Americans to the fact that it is not immigrants that are causing these economic problems it's the Amazon black hole it's technology 
advancing to a point where more and more of us are gonna have a harder and harder time making ends meet and the path forward is dr. King's guaranteed minimum income which I have rebranded the freedom dividend because it tests better with more Americans with a word freedom in it that was a joke that's true it's both the truth and a joke so this is what my campaign is all about we've raised millions of dollars in the average donations only seventeen dollars 
and eighty three cents so my fans are even cheaper than Bernie's fans oh yeah but we're gaining steam all the time we are again my member I just got my CNN Town Hall next Sunday so you can tune in at 8:00 p.m. but I will be the first to say there is no way I can do this alone that without your moral authority without your leadership without your activism this dream will not make it across the finish line we will not be able to transform this economy into an 
economy that actually works for human beings for families and for your children I need your help in the biggest way I was with Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton California we're talking about universal basic income which is an another name this goes by raise your hand if you heard of universal basic income all right so if you haven't now you have universal basic income is just a policy where everyone gets a certain amount of money and in my plan the 
freedom dividend every American adult would receive $1,000 a month free and clear no questions asked from day one this would be a hundred hundreds of billions of dollars into African American communities every year forever and there's nothing stopping a majority of citizens in a democracy from making this happen nothing at all law in Alaska it came this close to being law here in the United States and 
we need it more than ever but there is no way that I Andrew yang can make this happen without your help so when I was with Michael Tubbs in Stockton California we're talking about universal basic income we had a panels a smaller group than this and then he said to me something he put his arm around me and said Andrew you can say things that I cannot and get away with it and I looked at him I said thank you but you can say things I cannot and get away with in the 
same way they're just different things but we need to team up in the biggest way the country needs your moral leadership and authority more than ever right now and if you bring the moral leadership I will bring the math I will be the guy who beats Donald Trump in 2020 we will take this case all the way to the White House and win because the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math thank you all very much now a national network thank you 
andrew yang give my hand [Applause] you 
we are experiencing the greatest technological and economic shift in human history we need a way to help millions of Americans transition through this period and a universal basic income is the best and most efficient way to do that hello I'm Andrew yang and I'm running for president as a Democrat in 2020 I believe I have the right vision priorities and values to improve the lives of millions of Americans seven years ago I started venture for America 
to train hundreds of young entrepreneurs to build businesses in Detroit Cleveland Baltimore and other communities across the country together we helped create thousands of jobs but during this time I came to realize that technology has already wiped out 4 million manufacturing jobs in Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania and other states and it's about to do the same thing to people who work in retail food service and food prep customer service transportation as 
well as industries like insurance accounting medicine and law I saw so much over the last number of years traveling this country what I experienced was I opened her to me where I would walk through abandoned neighborhoods and boarded up businesses I have two young boys and I'm deeply concerned about the future that they're going to grow up in if we don't change things dramatically they're gonna grow up in a country with fewer and fewer 
opportunities and a handful of companies and individuals reaping the gains from new technologies while the rest of us struggle to find opportunities and eventually lose our jobs and it doesn't need to be that way under my plan every American adult will receive $1,000 a month free and clear paid for by a new tax on the companies that are benefiting most from automation if we provide a universal basic income Americans will be able to go back to school move for a new 
opportunity to start their own business and really have their head up as they plan for the future with your help we can make universal basic income a reality join us let's build a new kind of economy one that puts people first [Music] you
