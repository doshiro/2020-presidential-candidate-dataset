thank you very much mr. speaker mr. vice president members of Congress the first lady of the United States and citizen of South America tonight as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month we are reminded of our nation's path toward civil rights and the work that still remains to be done recent threats
recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries as well as last week shooting in Kansas City remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms each American generation passes the torch of truth liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present that torch is now in our hands
and we would use it to light up the world I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart a new chapter of American greatness is now beginning a new national pride is sweeping across our nation and a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp what we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit our allies will find that America
is once again ready to lead all the nations of the world Friend or Foe will find that America is strong America is proud and America is free in nine years the United States will celebrate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary two hundred and fifty years since the day we declared our independence it will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world but what will America look like as we reach our 250th year what kind of
country will we leave for our children I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future for too long we've watched our middle class shrink as we've explored it our jobs and wealth to foreign countries we financed and built one global project after another but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago Baltimore Detroit and so many other places throughout our land we've
defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate and we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled then in 2016 the earth shifted beneath our feet the rebellion started as a quiet protest spoken by families of all colors and creeds families who just wanted a fair
shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns but then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together from cities small and large all across our country finally the chorus became an earthquake and the people turned out by the tens of millions and they were all united by one very simple but crucial demand that America must put its own citizens first because only then can we
truly make America great again dyeing industries will come roaring back to life heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need our military will be given the resources it's brave warriors so richly deserve crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads bridges tunnels airports and railway sliming across a very very beautiful land our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately stop and our neglected inner
cities will see a rebirth of hope safety and opportunity above all else we will keep our promises to the American people it's been a little over a month since my inauguration and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises since my election Ford Fiat Chrysler General Motors Sprint Softbank Lockheed Intel Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the
United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs the stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th a record we've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic and it is a fantastic new f-35 jet fighter and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government we have placed a hiring freeze or non-military and non-essential
federal workers we have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban thank you and a lifetime ban when becoming lobbyists for a foreign government we have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job crushing regulations creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency
and we're imposing a new rule which mandates that for everyone new regulation too old regulations must be eliminated to stop the regulations that threatened the future and livelihood of our great coal miners we have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota access pipelines thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs and I've issued a new directive
that new American pipelines be made with American steel we have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing trans-pacific partnership and with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau we are formed to counsel with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams
to protect our citizens I have directed the Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime I have further ordered the department's of Homeland Security and justice along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation we will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and
we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted at the same time my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security by finally enforcing our immigration laws we will raise wages help the unemployed save billions and billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone we want all Americans to succeed but that can't happen in an environment of
lawless chaos we must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders for that reason we will soon begin the construction of a great great wall along our southern border as we speak tonight we are removing gang members drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens bad ones are going out as I speak and as I promised throughout the campaign to any in Congress who do not believe we should
enforce our laws I would ask you this one question what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs their income or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders our obligation is to serve protect and defend the citizens of the United States we are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism according to data provided by the
Department of Justice the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorist and terrorism related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country we have seen the attacks at home from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes even the World Trade Center we have seen the attacks in France in Belgium in Germany and all over the world it is not compassion but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot
occur those given a high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values we cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists that is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep those
out who will do us harm as promised I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy Isis a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians and men and women and children of all faiths and all beliefs we will work with our allies including our friends and allies in the Muslim world to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet I have also imposed new sanctions on
entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel finally I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court from my list of 20 judges who will defend our Constitution I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight Thank You Maria her late great husband Antonin Scalia will forever be a symbol
of American justice to fill his seat we have chosen judge Neal Gorsuch a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law he was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination tonight as I outlined the next steps we must take as a country we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited 94 million Americans are out of the labor force over 43 million people are now living in poverty and
over 43 million Americans are on food stamps more than one in five people in their prime working years are not working we have the worst financial recovery in 65 years in the last eight years the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other presidents combined we've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade
Organization in 2001 our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly 800 billion dollars and overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party it will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history but to accomplish our goals at home and abroad
we must restart the engine of the American economy making it easier for companies to do business in the United States and much much harder for companies to leave our country right now American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world my economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone
it will be a big big cut at the same time we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class we must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers have to be currently when we ship products out of America many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes but when foreign companies ship their products into America we charge them nothing or almost nothing I just met with officials and workers from a great American
company harley-davidson in fact they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles made in the USA on the front lawn of the White House and they wanted me to ride one and I said no thank you at our meeting I asked them how are you doing how is business they said that it's good I asked them further how are you doing with other countries mainly international sales they told me without even complaining because they have been
so mistreated for so long that they become used to it that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate they said that in the case of another country they tax their motorcycles at 100% they weren't even asking for a change but I am I believe I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade it's been a long time since we had fair trade the
first Republican President Abraham Lincoln warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people Lincoln was right and it's time we heeded his advice and his words I am NOT going to let America and it's great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer they have taken advantage of our country no longer I'm going to bring back millions of jobs protecting our workers also
means reforming our system of legal immigration the current outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers and puts great pressure on taxpayers nations around the world like Canada Australia and many others have a merit-based immigration system it's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country or to be able to support themselves financially yet in America we do not enforce this rule straining the
very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon according to the National Academy of Sciences our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year switching away from this current system of lower skilled immigration and instead adopting a merit-based system we will have so many more benefits it will save countless dollars raise workers wages and help struggling families including immigrant families enter the
middle class and they will do it quickly and they will be very very happy indeed I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible as long as we focus on the following goals to improve jobs and wages for Americans to strengthen our nation's security and to restore respect for our laws if we are guided by the well-being of American citizens that I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country
for decades another Republican President Dwight d Eisenhower initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program the building of the interstate highway system the time has come for a new program of national rebuilding America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling with the six trillion
dollars we could have rebuilt our country twice and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate to launch our national rebuilding I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a one trillion dollar investment in infrastructure of the United States financed through both public and private capital creating millions of new jobs this effort will be guided by two core principles by American and higher
American tonight I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice increase access lower costs and at the same time provide better health care mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country the way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance and that is
what we are going to do Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits as an example Arizona went up a hundred and sixteen percent last year alone governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state the state of Kentucky and it's unsustainable and collapsing one-third of the counties have only one insurer and they're losing them fast they are losing them so fast they're leaving and many Americans have
no choice at all there's no choice left remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan we now know that all of those promises have been totally broken Obamacare is collapsing and we must act decisively to protect all Americans action is not a choice it is a necessity so I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster
here are the principles that you guide Congress as we move to create a better health care system for all Americans first we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges secondly we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts but it must be the plan
they want not the plan forced on them by our government thirdly we should give our state governor's the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out fourth we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately
and finally the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care so important everything that is broken in our country can be fixed every problem can be solved and every hurting family can find healing and hope our citizens deserve this and so much more so why not join forces and finally get
the job done and get it done right on this and so many other things Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people my administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare access and a forum to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave to invest in women's health and to
promote clean air and clean water and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure true love for our people requires us to find common ground to advance the common good and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future an incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all today is rare disease day and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease
survivor Megan Crowley Megan Megan was diagnosed with pompe disease a rare and serious illness when she was 15 months old she was not expected to live past five on receiving this news Megan's dad John fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child he founded a company to look for a cure and help develop the drug that saved Megan's life today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame
meagan stories about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keeps too many advances like the one that saved Megan's life from reaching those in need if we slash the restraints not just at the FDA but across our government then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan in fact our children will grow up in a nation of miracles but to achieve this
future we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child education is the civil rights issue of our time I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice could disadvantaged youth including millions of African American and Latino children these families should be free to choose the public private charter magnet religious or homeschool that is right for them
joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman Denisha Merryweather as a young girl Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice but then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning great learning center with the help of a tax credit and his scholarship program today she is the first in her family to graduate not just from high school but from college later this year she will get her master's degree in
social work we want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like danisha but to break the cycle of poverty we must also break the cycle of violence the murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single year increase in nearly half a century in Chicago more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher this is not acceptable in our society
every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community to attend a great school and to have access to a high paying job but to create this future we must work with not against not against the men and women of law enforcement we must build bridges of cooperation and trust not drive the wedge of disunity and disagree it's what it is division it's pure unadulterated division we have to unify police and Sheriff's are
members of our community their friends and neighbors their mothers and fathers sons and daughters and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound we must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement and we must support the victims of crime I have ordered the department of homeland security to create an office to serve American victims the office is called voice victims of immigration
crime engagement we are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by a median and silenced by special interests joining us joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them their names are Jamil Shah Susan Oliver Jenna Oliver and Jessica Davis Jamil 17-year old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison Jamil
sure jr. was an incredible young man with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback but he never got the chance his father who is in the audience tonight has become a very good friend of mine Jamil thank you also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis their husbands deputy sheriff Danny Oliver and detective Michael Davis were slain in the line of
duty in California they were pillars of their community these brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations should have never been in our country sitting with Susan is her daughter Jenna Jenna I want you to know that your father was a hero and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you to Jamil Jana Susan and Jessica I want
you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice your loved ones will never ever be forgotten we will always honor their memory finally to keep America safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war if they must they have to fight and they only have to win I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military eliminates the defense sequester
and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history my budget will also increase funding for our veterans our veterans have delivered for this nation and now we must deliver for them the challenges we face as a nation are great but our people are even greater and none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform we are blessed to be joined tonight by Corrine Owens the widow of US Navy
special operator senior Chief William Ryan Owens Ryan died as he lived a warrior and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation I just spoke to our great general mattis just now who reconfirmed that and I quote Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity thank you
and Ryan is looking down right now you know that and he's very happy because I think he just broke a record first the Bible teaches us there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends Ryan lay down his life for his friends for his country and for our freedom and we will never forget Ryan to those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be look no further than the heroes who wear a uniform our foreign policy calls for a direct robust
and meaningful engagement with the world it is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe we strongly support NATO an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethrone fascism and the cold and defeated communism but our partners must meet their financial obligations and now based on our very strong and frank discussions they are beginning to do just that in
fact I can tell you the money is pouring in very nice we expect our partners whether in NATO the Middle East or in the Pacific to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations and pay their fair share of the cost have to do that we will respect historic institutions but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations and they have to respect our rights as a nation also
three nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path my job is not to represent the world my job is to represent the United States of America but we know that America is better off when there is less conflict not more we must learn from the mistakes of the past we have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout
the world all across the world the only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters in many cases is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long long process of rebuilding America is willing to find new friends and to forge new partnerships where shared interests align we want harmony and stability not war and conflict we want peace wherever peace can be found America is friends today with former
enemies some of our closest allies decades ago fought on the opposite side of of these terrible terrible wars this history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world hopefully that two hundred and fiftieth year for America will see a world that is more peaceful more just and more free on our 100th anniversary in 1876 citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial at that celebration the
country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time Remington unveiled the first typewriter an early attempt was made an electric light Thomas Edison showed an automatic Telegraph and an electric pen imagine the wonders our country could know in America's two hundred and fiftieth year think of the marvels we can achieve if
we simply set free the dreams of our people cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect and streets where mothers are safe from fear schools where children learn in peace and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask when we have all of this we will have
made America greater than ever before for all Americans this is our vision this is our mission but we can only get there together we are one people with one destiny we all bleed the same blood we all salute the same great American flag and we all are made by the same God when we fulfill this vision when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began the time for small
thinking is over the time for trivial fights is behind us we just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts the bravery to express the hopes that ser our souls and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action from now on America will hold by our aspirations not burdened by our fears inspired by the future not bound by failures of the past and guided by a vision not blinded by our doubts I am asking all citizens to
embrace this renewal of the American spirit I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment believe in yourselves believe in your future and believe once more in America thank you god bless you and God bless the United States
mr. president mr. secretary general distinguished delegates ambassadors and world leaders seven decades of history have passed through this hall in all of their richness and drama where I stand the world has heard from presidents and premiers at the height of the Cold War we have seen the foundation of nations we have seen the ringleaders of revolution we have beheld saints who inspired us with hope rebels who stirred us with passion and heroes who
emboldened us with courage all here to share plans proposals visions and ideas on the world's biggest stage like those who met us before our time is one of great contests high stakes and clear choices the essential divide that runs all around the world and throughout history is once again thrown into stark relief it is the divide between those whose thirst for control deludes them into thinking they are destined to rule over others and those people and nations
who want only to rule themselves I have the immense privilege of addressing you today as the elected leader of a nation that prizes liberty independence and self-government above all the United States after having spent over two-and-a-half trillion dollars since my election to completely rebuild our great military is also by far the world's powerful nation hopefully it will never have to use this power Americans know that in a world where others seek
conquest and domination our nation must be strong in wealth in might and in spirit that is why the United States vigorously defends the traditions and customs that have made us who we are like my beloved country each nation represented in this Hall as a cherished history culture and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating and which gives us our singular potential and strength the free world must embrace its national foundations it must not
attempt to erase them or replace them looking around and all over is large magnificent planet the truth is plain to see if you want freedom take pride in your country if you want democracy hold on to your sovereignty and if you want peace love your nation wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first the future does not belong to globalists the future belongs to Patriots the future belongs to sovereign
and independent nations who protect their citizens respect their neighbors and honor the differences that make each country special and unique it is why we in the United States have embarked on an exciting program of national renewal and everything we do we are focused on empowering the dreams and aspirations of our citizens thanks to our pro-growth economic policies our domestic unemployment rate reached its lowest level in over half a century
fueled by massive tax cuts and regulations cuts jobs are being produced at a historic rate six billion Americans have been added to the employment rolls in under three years last month African American Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment reached their lowest rates ever recorded we are marshalling our nation's vast energy abundance and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world
wages are rising incomes are soaring and 2.5 million Americans have been lifted out of poverty in less than three years as we rebuild the unrivaled might of the American military we are also revitalizing our alliances by making it very clear that all of our partners are expected to pay their fair share of the tremendous defense burden which the United States has borne in the past at the center of our vision for national renewal is an ambitious
campaign to reform international trade for decades the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in very bad faith as jobs were outsourced a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class in America the result was 4.2 mm lost manufacturing jobs and 15 trillion dollars in trade deficits over the last quarter century the United States is now taking that decisive action to end this grave economic injustice our goal is
simple we want balanced trade that is both fair and reciprocal we have worked closely with our partners in Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA with the brand new and hopefully bipartisan US Mexico Canada agreement tomorrow I will join Prime Minister Abbey of Japan to continue our progress in finalizing a terrific new trade deal as the United Kingdom makes preparations to exit the European Union I have made clear that we stand ready to complete an exceptional
new trade agreement with the UK that will bring tremendous benefits to both of our countries we are working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on a magnificent new trade deal the most important difference in America's new approach on trade concerns a relationship with China in 2001 China was admitted through the World Trade Organization our leaders then argued that this decision would compel China to liberalize its economy and strengthen
protections to provide things that were unacceptable to us and for private property and for the rule of law two decades later this theory has been tested and proven completely wrong not only has China declined to adopt promised reforms it has embraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers heavy state subsidies currency manipulation product dumping forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property
and also trade secrets on a grand scale as just one example I recently met the CEO of a terrific American company micron technology at the white house micron produces memory chips used in countless electronics to advance the Chinese government's five-year economic plan a company owned by the Chinese state allegedly stole microns designs valued at up to eight point seven billion dollars soon the Chinese company obtains patents for nearly an identical
product and micron was banned from selling its own goods in China but we are seeking justice the United States lost 60,000 factories after China entered the WTO this is happening to other countries all over the globe the world trade organization needs drastic change the second largest economy in the world should not be permitted to declare itself a developing country in order to game the system at others expense for years these abuses were tolerated
ignored or even encouraged globalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests but as far as America is concerned those days are over to confront these unfair practices I placed massive tariffs on more than 500 billion dollars worth of Chinese made goods already as a result of these tariffs supply chains are relocating back to America and to other nations and
billions of dollars are being paid to our treasury the American people are absolutely committed to restoring balance to our relationship with China hopefully we can reach an agreement that will be beneficial for both countries but as I have made very clear I will not accept a bad deal for the American people as we endeavor to stabilize our relationship we're also carefully monitoring the
situation in Hong Kong the world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations in which China commits to protect Hong Kong's freedom legal system and democratic ways of life how China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future we are all counting on President Xi as a great leader the United States does not seek conflict
with any other nation we desire peace cooperation and mutual gain with all but I will never fail to defend America's interests one of the greatest security threats facing peace-loving nations today is the repressive regime in Iran the regime's record of death and destruction is well known to us all not only is Iran the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism but Iran's leaders are fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen at the same time
the regime is squandering the nation's wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them we must never allow this to happen to stop Iran's path to nuclear weapons and missiles I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal which has very little time remaining did not allow inspection of important sites and did not cover ballistic missiles following our
withdrawal we have implemented severe economic sanctions on the country hoping to free itself from sanctions the regime has escalated its violent and unprovoked aggression in response to Iran's recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities we just impose the highest level of sanctions on Iran central bank and sovereign wealth fund all nations have a duty to act no responsible government should subsidize Iran's bloodlust as long as I
runs menacing behavior continues sanctions will not be lifted they will be tightened Iran's leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches for 40 years the world has listened to Iran's rulers as they lash out at everyone else for the problems they alone have created they conduct ritual chants of death to
America and traffic in monstrous anti-semitism last year the country's supreme leader stated Israel is a malignant cancerous tumor that has to be removed and eradicated it is possible and it will happen America will never tolerate such anti-semitic hate fanatics have long used hatred of Israel to distract from their own failures thankfully there is a growing recognition in the wider Middle East that the countries of the region
share common interests in battling extremism and unleashing Economic Opportunity that is why it is so important to have full normalized relations between Israel and its neighbors only a relationship built on common interest mutual respect and religious tolerance can forge a better future Iran citizens deserve a government that cares about reducing poverty ending corruption and increasing jobs not
stealing their money to fund and massacre abroad and at home after four decades of failure it is time for Iran's leaders to step forward and to stop threatening other countries and focus on building up their own country it is time for Iran's leaders to finally put the Iranian people first America is ready to embrace friendship with all who genuine seek peace and respect many of America's closest friends today were once our greatest foes the United States has
never believed in permanent enemies we want partners not adversaries America knows that while anyone can make war only the most courageous can choose peace for this same reason we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula I have told Kim jong-un what I truly believe that like Iran his country is full of tremendous untapped potential but that you realize that promise North Korea must denuclearize around the world our message is clear
America's goal is lasting America's goal is harmony and america's goal is not to go with these endless wars wars that never end with that gold in mind my administration is also pursuing the hope of a brighter future in Afghanistan unfortunately the Taliban has chosen to continue their savage attacks we will continue to work with our coalition of Afghan partners to stamp out terrorism and we will never stop working to make peace a reality here in the Western
Hemisphere we are joining with our partners to ensure stability and opportunity all across the region in that mission one of our most critical challenges is illegal immigration which undermines prosperity rips apart societies and empowers ruthless criminal cartels mass illegal migration is unfair unsafe and unsustainable for everyone involved the sending countries and the depleted countries and they become depleted very
fast but the youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste the receiving countries are overburdened with more of migrants than they can responsibly accept and the migrants themselves are exploited assaulted and abused by vicious coyotes nearly one-third of women who make the journey north to our border are sexually assaulted along the way yet here in the United States and around the world there was a growing cottage industry of
radical activists and non-governmental organizations that promote human smuggling these groups encourage illegal migration and demand your ratio of national borders today I have a message for those open border activists who cloak themselves in the rhetoric of social justice your policies are not just your policies are cruel and evil you are empowering criminal organizations that prey on innocent men women and children you put your own
false sense of virtue before the lives well-being and countless innocent people when you undermine border security you are undermining human rights and human dignity many of the countries here today are coping with the challenges of uncontrolled migration each of you has the absolute right to protect your borders and so of course there's our country today we must resolve to work together to end human smuggling and human
trafficking and put these criminal networks out of business for good to our country I can tell you sincerely we are working closely with our friends in the region including Mexico Canada Guatemala Honduras El Salvador and Panama to uphold the integrity of borders and ensure safety and prosperity for our people I would like to thank President Lopez Obrador of Mexico for the great cooperation we're receiving and for right now putting 27,000 troops on our
southern border Mexico is showing us great respect and I respect them in return the u.s. we have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration to anyone conducting crossings of our border illegally please hear these words do not pay the smugglers do not pay the Coyotes do not put yourself in danger do not put your children in danger because if you make it here you will not be allowed in you will be promptly returned
home you will not be released into our country as long as I am President of the United States we will enforce our laws and protect our borders for all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere our goal is to help people invest in the bright futures of their own nation our region is full of such incredible promise dreams waiting to be built a national destinies for all and they are waiting also to be pursued throughout the hemisphere there
are millions of hard-working patriotic young people eager to build innovate and achieve but these nations cannot reach their potential if a generation of youth abandoned their homes in search of a life elsewhere we want every nation in our region to flourish and its people to thrive in freedom and peace in that mission we are also committed to supporting those people in the Western Hemisphere who live under brutal oppression such as
those in Cuba Nicaragua and Venezuela according to a recent report from the UN Human Rights Council women in Venezuela stand in line for 10 hours a day waiting for food over 15,000 people have been detained as political prisoners modern-day death squads are carrying out thousands of extrajudicial killings the dictator Maduro is a Cuban puppet protected by Cuban bodyguards hiding from his own people while Cuba plunders Venezuela's oil wealth to sustain its
own corrupt communist rule since I last spoke in this hall the United States and our partners have built a historic coalition of 55 countries that recognize the legitimate government of Venezuela - the Venezuelans trapped in this nightmare please know that all of America is united behind you the United States has vast quantities of humanitarian aid ready and waiting to be delivered we're watching the Venezuela situation very
closely we await the day when democracy will be restored when Venezuela will be free and when Liberty will prevail throughout this hemisphere one of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism it's the Recker of nations and destroyer of societies events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice they are not about equality they are not about lifting up
the poor and they are certainly not about good of the nation socialism and communism are about one thing only power for the ruling class today I repeat a message for the world that I have delivered at home America will never be a socialist country in the last century socialism and communism killed 100 million people sadly as we see in Venezuela the death toll continues in this country these totalitarian ideologies combined with modern
technology have the power to excise new and disturbing forms of suppression and domination for this reason the United States is taking steps to better screen foreign technology and investments and to protect our data and our security we urge every nation president to do the same freedom and democracy must be constantly guarded and protected both abroad and from within we must always be skeptical of those who want conformity and control
even in free nations we see alarming signs and new challenges to Liberty a small number of social media platforms are acquiring immense power over what we can see and over what we are allowed to say a permanent political class is openly disdainful dismissive and defiant of the will of the people a faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule media and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories traditions and
values in the United States my administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech a free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people and a free people must never ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing coercing cancelling or blacklisting their own neighbors as we defend American values we affirm the right of all people to live in dignity for this reason my
administration is working with other nations to stop criminalizing of homosexuality and we stand in solidarity with LGBTQ people who live in countries that punish jail or execute individuals based upon sexual orientation we are also championing the role of women in our societies nations that empower women are much wealthier safer and much more politically stable is therefore vital not only to a nation's prosperity but
also is vital to its national security to pursue women's economic development guided by these principles my administration launched the women's global development and prosperity initiatives the W GDP is the first-ever government-wide approach to women's economic empowerment working to ensure that women all over the planet had the legal right to own and inherit property work in the same industries has been travel freely and access credit and
institutions yesterday I was also pleased to host leaders for a discussion about an iron Claire American commitment protecting religious leaders and also protecting religious freedom this fundamental right is under growing threat around the world hard to believe but 80% of the world's population lives in countries where religious liberty is in significant danger or even completely outlawed Americans will never fire or tire in our effort to defend and promote
freedom of worship and religion we want and support religious liberty for all Americans will also never tire of defending innocent life we are aware that many United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand right up until the moment of delivery global bureaucrats have absolutely no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life like many nations here today we in
America believe that every child born and unborn is a sacred gift from God there is no circumstance under which the United States will allow international entries to trample on the rights of our citizens including the right to self-defense that is why this year I announced that we will never ratify the UN arms trade treaty which would threaten the liberties of law-abiding American citizens the United States will always uphold our constitutional right
to keep and bear arms we will always uphold our Second Amendment the core rights and values America defends today were inscribed in America's founding documents our nation's founders understood that there will always be those who believe they are entitled to wield power and control over others journey advances under many names and many theories but it always comes down to the desire for domination it protects not the interests of many but the
privilege of few our founders gave us a system designed to restrain this dangerous impulse they chose to entrust American power to those most invested in the fate of our nation a proud and fiercely independent people the true good of the nation can only be pursued by those who love it by citizens who are rooted in its history who are nourished by its culture committed to its values attached to its people and who know that his future is
theirs to build or theirs to lose Patriots see a nation and its destiny in ways no one else can liberty is only preserved sovereignty is only secured democracy is only sustained greatness is only realized by the will and devotion of Patriots in their spirit is found the strength to resist oppression the inspiration to forge legacy the goodwill to seek friendship and the bravery to reach for peace love of our nation's makes the world better
for all nations so to all the leaders here today join us in the most fulfilling mission a person could have the most profound contribution anyone can make lift up your nations cherish your culture honor your histories treasure your citizens make your country strong and prosperous and righteous honor the dignity of your people and nothing will be outside of your reach when our nation's are greater the future will be brighter people will be happier
and our partnerships will be stronger with God's help together we will cast off the enemies of Liberty and overcome the oppressors of dignity we will set new standards of living and reached new heights of human achievement we will rediscover ultros unravel old mysteries and make thrilling new breakthroughs and we will find more beautiful friendship and more harmony among nations than ever before my fellow leaders the path to peace and

what a great honor to be able to introduce for the first time ever anywhere the 45th President of the United States of America Donald J Trump go get that me Chief Justice Roberts President Carter President Clinton President Bush President Obama fellow Americans and people of the world thank you we the
citizens of America are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people together we will determine the course of America and the world for many many years to come we will face challenges we will confront hardships but we will get the job done every four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power and we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for
their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent thank you today's ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people for too long a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while
the people have borne the cost Washington flourished but the people did not share in its wealth politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country their victories have not been your victories their triumphs have not been your triumphs and while they celebrated in our nation's capital there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land
that all changes starting right here and right now because this moment is your moment it belongs to you it belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America this is your day this is your celebration and this the United States of America is your country what truly matters is not which party controls our government but whether our government is controlled by the people January 20th
2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again The Forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer everyone is listening to you now you came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before at the center of this movement is a crucial
conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens Americans want great schools for their children safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves these are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public but for too many of our citizens a different reality exists mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our
nation an education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential this American carnage stops right here and stops right now we are one nation and their pain is our pain their dreams are our dreams and
their success will be our success we share one heart one home and one glorious destiny the oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans for many decades we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry subsidize the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military we've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of
dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay we've made other countries rich while the wealth strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon one by one the factory shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the
world but that is the past and now we are looking only to the future we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city in every foreign capital and in every Hall of power from this day forward a new vision will govern our land from this day forward it's going to be only America first America first every decision on trade on taxes on immigration on Foreign Affairs will
be made to benefit American workers and American families we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products stealing our companies and destroying our jobs protection will lead to great prosperity and strength I will fight for you with every breath in my body and I will never ever let you down America will start winning again winning like never before we will bring back our
jobs we will bring back our borders we will bring back our wealth and we will bring back our dreams we will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation we will get our people off of welfare and back to work rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor we will follow two simple rules by American and hire American we will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations
of the world but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but rather to let it shine as an example we will shine for everyone to follow we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth at the bedrock of our
politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity we must speak our minds openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity when America is united America is totally unstoppable
there should be no fear we are protected and we will always be protected we will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and most importantly we will be protected by God finally we must think big and dream even bigger in America we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving we will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action
constantly complaining but never doing anything about it the time for empty talk is over now arrives the hour of action do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done no challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America we will not fail our country will thrive and prosper again we stand at the birth of a new millenium ready to unlock the mysteries of space to free the earth
from the miseries of disease and to harness the energies industries and technologies of tomorrow a new national pride will stir ourselves lift our sights and heal our divisions it's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget that whether we are black or brown or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag and whether a child is
born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska they look up at the same night sky they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same Almighty Creator so to all Americans in every city near and far small and large from Mountain to mountain from ocean to ocean hear these words you will never be ignored again your voice your hopes and your dreams

thank you to Mike Pence thank you
really our immigration system has been badly broken for a very long time over the decades many presidents and many lawmakers have come and gone and no real progress has been made on immigration we are now living with the consequences and they are tragic brought about by decades of political stalemate partisan gridlock and national neglect there is a humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border that requires urgent action thousands of children are being
exploited by ruthless coyotes and vicious cartels and gangs one in three women is sexually assaulted on the dangerous journey north in fact many loving mothers give their young daughters birth control pills for the long journey up to the United States because they know they may be raped or sexually a constant or assaulted nearly 50 migrants a day are being referred for urgent medical care vast quantities of lethal narcotics are flooding through
our border and into our communities including meth cocaine heroin and fentanyl drugs kill seventy eight thousand Americans a year and cost our society in excess of seven hundred billion dollars heroin alone kills 300 Americans a week ninety percent of which comes across our southern border we can stop heroin illegal immigration reduces wages and strains public services the lack of border control provides a gateway in a very wide and open gateway
for criminals and gang members to enter the United States including the criminal aliens who murdered a brave California police officer only a day after Christmas I've gotten to know and love angel moms dads and family who lost loved ones to people illegally in our country I want this to end it's got to end now these are not talking points these are the heartbreaking realities that are hurting innocent precious human beings every single day on both sides of
the border as a candidate for president I promised I would fix this crisis and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other our immigration system should be the subject of pride not a source of shame as it is all over the world our immigration system should be the envy of the world not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction the good news is these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right both
sides in Washington must simply come together listen to each other put down their armor build trust reach across the aisle and find solutions it is time to reclaim our future from the extreme voices who fear compromise and demand open borders which means drugs pouring in human trafficking and a lot of crime that is why I am here today to break the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern
border if we are successful in this effort we will then have the best chance in a very long time at real bipartisan immigration reform and it won't stop here it will keep going on we do it all the proposal I will outline today is base Dorn first and foremost on input from our border agents and homeland security professionals and professionals they are they know what they're doing it is a compassionate response to the
ongoing tragedy on our southern border in recent weeks we have met with large numbers of Democrat lawmakers to hear their ideas and suggestions by incorporating the priorities of rank-and-file democrats in our plan we hope they will offer their enthusiastic support and I think many will this is a common-sense compromise both parties should embrace the radical left can never control our borders I will never let it happen walls are not amoral in
fact they are the opposite of immoral because they will save many lives and stop drugs from pouring into our country our plan includes the following 800 million dollars in urgent humanitarian assistance eight hundred and five million dollars for drug detection technology to help secure our ports of entry an additional 2,750 border agents and law enforcement professionals 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce the
court backlog of believe it or not almost 900,000 cases however the whole concept of having lengthy trials for anyone who sets one foot in our country unlawfully must be changed by Congress it is unsustainable it is ridiculous few places in the world would even consider such an impossible nightmare our plan includes crit Nicoll measures to protect migrant children from exploitation and abuse this includes a new system to allow
Central American miners to apply for asylum in their home countries and reform to promote family reunification for unaccompanied children thousands of whom wind up on our border doorstep to physically secure our border the plan includes 5.7 billion dollars for a strategic deployment of physical barriers or a wall this is not a 2,000 mile concrete structure from sea to sea these are steel barriers in high priority locations much of the border is
already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water we already have many miles of barrier including 115 miles that we are currently building or under contract it will be done quickly our request will add another 230 miles this year in the areas our border agents most urgently need it will have an unbelievable impact if we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border the crime rate and drug problem in our
country would be quickly and greatly reduced some say it could be cut in half because these criminals drug smugglers gangs and traffickers do not stop at our border they permeate throughout our country and they end up in some places where you'd least expect them they go all over our country a steel barrier will help us stop illegal immigration while safely directing commerce to our lawful ports of entry many of these security ideas have been
proposed by Democrats themselves and all of them have been supported Democrats in the past including a physical barrier wall or fence furthermore in order to build the trust and goodwill necessary to begin real immigration reform there are two more elements to my plan number one is three years of legislative relief for 700,000 daca recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago this
extension will give them access to work permits Social Security numbers and protection from deportation most importantly secondly our proposal provides a three-year extension of temporary protected status or TPS this means that 300,000 immigrants whose protective status is facing expiration will now have three more years of certainty so that Congress can work on a larger immigration deal which everybody wants Republicans and Democrats and our
farmers and vineyards won't be affected because lawful and regulated entry into our country will be easy and consistent that is our plan border security daca TPS and many other things straightforward fair reasonable and common-sense with lots of compromise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to bring this bill to a vote this week in the United States Senate our proposal is not intended to solve all of our immigration challenges this
plan solves the immediate crisis and it is a horrible crisis it is a humanitarian crisis like we rarely see in our country and it provides humanitarian relief delivers real border security and immediately reopens our federal government if we are successful in this effort then we can start the border project of remaking our immigration system for the 21st century once the government is open and we have made a down payment on
border security and immigration reform starts to happen I plan to Covino weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House so we can do a finished product a great product a product that we can all be proud of having to do with that elusive immigration problem whatever we do I can promise you this I will never forget that my first duty and ultimate loyalty is to you the American people any reforms we make to our immigration
system will be designed to improve your lives make your community safer and make our nation more prosperous and secure for generations to come thank you and God bless america thank you so we were just listening in there to the US president Donald Trump as he gave an address at the White House today to address the ongoing government shutdown and of course that border wall which was a cornerstone of his campaign promises when he was a candidate part of
what we heard from the US president as he outlined what he calls a humanitarian and security crisis that is existing at the southern border with Mexico and he outlined a proposal which he says he hopes Democrats can be on board with he says that he has consulted with a number of them and has tried to include some of their suggestions as well part of it is a monetary breakdown of urgent humanitarian relief as well as drug detection technology in the millions of
dollars and also 75 new immigration judge judges that would be part of the legal team who could process the number of claims and that backlog that we're currently seeing at the border of people trying to enter the United States now that particular point is something that Democrats have also been wanting for but he did not ignore the one piece that our valent Lee against in that is 5.7 billion dollars for what he called a strategic deployment of physical barrier
or otherwise known as that wall that he's been promising now we know that the CBC's Melissa Kent was watching that address from the bureau in New York and she joins us now I just highlighted some of the points he certainly had a lot to say maybe you can break it down for us a little bit more yeah so you hit on some of the points money money for humanitarian help drug detection technology additional border guards I think you mentioned judge judge teams to
get rid of the backlog he of course says that there are 900,000 cases backlog right now I'm sure there are fact checkers out there looking into that what the big the big concession on his part and what we'd been hearing all day is the compromises to these so-called dreamers immigrants without status here in the United States so basically temporary immigration compromises for his permanent wall along the southern border with Mexico so this
is nothing new this is a these are proposals that have come up in the past basically it gives dreamers in the United States so these are people who came to the United States were taken before the age of 16 and before 2007 were brought here by their parents it gives them status a temporary worker permits a social security cards prevent protection from deportation there are seven hundred and forty thousand so-called dreamers here in the US he
also said that these extra protections or deportation protections would extend to their other sorry they're called a temporary protection status those with temporary protection status those working in the United States already so those are some of the things that he offered in exchange for his wall and of course he repeated what he's been saying for months now that the borders are unprotected that crime criminals and drugs are flowing
across the border and greater and greater numbers of that only by building this physical wall will the numbers of crimes caused by these illegal immigrants and the and the the the drug problems in the United States be reduced he even said almost by half if they built the wall certainly those are some key points in that extension that concession that he was making for about three years when it comes to the so-called dreamers and those individuals
with temporary protected status and just a final point that we'll make here before we let Melissa go and thank you very much for covering that all off for us as we know that he also mentioned he wants the Senate majority leader to bring that bill to a vote this week which would if it is passed essentially potentially and the months-long now government shutdown so thank you again Melissa Kent we know we'll have more from you in this coverage coming up that
is Melissa Kent in New York and you are watching CBC News Network stay with us
when was the last time anybody saw us beating let's say China in a trade deal they kill us I'd be China all the time all the time when did we beat Japan at anything they send their cars over by the millions and what do we do when was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo it doesn't exist folks they beat us all the time when do we beat Mexico at the border they're laughing at us at our stupidity and now they're beating us economically they are not our friend
believe me but they're killing us economically the US has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems thank you it's true and these are the best in the finest when Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists and some I assume are
good people but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting and it only makes common sense it only makes common sense they're sending us not the right people it's coming from more than Mexico it's coming from all over south and Latin America and it's coming probably probably from the Middle East but we don't know because we have no protection and we have no competence we don't know what's happening and it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East they become rich I'm in competition with them they just built a hotel in Syria can you believe this they built a hotel when I have to build a hotel I pay interest they don't have to pay interest because they took the oil that when we left Iraq I said we should have taken so now Isis has the oil and what they don't have Iran has and in nineteen and I will tell you this and I said it very strongly
years ago i said and i love the military and i want to have the strongest military that we've ever had and we needed more now than ever but I said don't hit iraq because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East Iran is going to take over the Middle East Iran and somebody else will get the oil and it turned out that Iran is now taking over a rack think of it Iran is taking over Iraq and they're taking it over big league we spent two trillion
dollars in Iraq two trillion we lost thousands of lives thousands in Iraq we have wounded soldiers who i love i love their great all over the place thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers and we have nothing we can't even go there we have nothing and every time we give Iraq equipment the first time a bullet goes off in the air they leave it last week I read 2,300 Humvees these are big vehicles were left behind for the enemy 2,000th you would say maybe two maybe 4
2000 through 300 sophisticated vehicles they ran and the enemy took him you're right last quarter it was just announced our gross domestic product a sign of strength right but not for us it was below zero who ever heard of this it's never below zero our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978 but think of a GTP below zero horrible labor participation rate and our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent don't
believe the five point six don't believe it that's right a lot of people up there can't get jobs they can't get jobs because there are no jobs because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs they all have our jobs but the real number the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even twenty one percent and nobody talks about it because it's a statistic that's fully nonsense our enemies are getting stronger and
stronger by the day and we as a country are getting weaker even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work it came out recently they have equipment that's 30 years old they don't even know if it worked and I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television because boy does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say that is a group of people and that is a nation that truly has no clue they don't know what
they're doing they don't know what they're doing we have a disaster called the big lie Obamacare Obamacare yesterday came out that costs are going for people up 29 39 49 and even fifty five percent and deductibles are through the roof you have to get hit by a tractor literally a tractor to use it because the deductibles are so high it's virtually useless it is a disaster and remember the five billion dollar website five billion we spent on a website and
to this day it doesn't work a five billion dollar website I have so many websites I have them all over the place I hire people they do a website of course to be three dollars five billion dollar website well you need somebody because politicians are all talk no action nothing's going to get done they will not bring us believe me to the promised land they will not as an example I've been on the circuit making speeches and
I hear my fellow Republicans and they're wonderful people I like them they all want me to support them they don't know how to bring it about they come up to my office I a meeting with three of them in the next week and they don't know are you running are you not running could we have your support what do we do how do we do it i like them and I hear their speeches and they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China what was the last time you heard china is killing us
they're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe it makes it impossible for our companies to compete impossible they're killing us but you don't hear that from anybody else you don't hear it from anybody else and I watch this features thank you I watched the speeches of these people and they say the Sun will rise the moon will set all sorts of wonderful things will happen of and people are saying what's going on I just want a job just get me a
job I don't need the rhetoric I want a job and that's what's happening and it's going to get worse because remember Obamacare really kicks in in 16 2016 Obama is going to be out playing golf he might even be on one of my courses i would invite him I actually would say I have the best courses in the world so I'd say you know what if you want to see I have one right next to the white house right on the Potomac if he'd like to play that's fine in fact I'd love him to
leave early and play that would be a very good thing but obamacare kicks in in 2016 really big lake it is going to be amazingly destructive doctors acquitting I have a friend who's a doctor and he said to me the other day Donald I never saw anything like it I have more accountants than I have nurses it's a disaster my patients are beside themselves they had a plan that was good they have no plan now we have to repeal Obamacare and it
can repair it by and and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody let it be for everybody but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government and we can do it so I've watched the politicians I've dealt with them all my life if you can't make a good deal with a politician then there's something wrong with you you're certainly not very good and that's what we have representing us they will never make America great again they
don't even have a chance they're controlled fully they're controlled fully by the lobbyists by the donors and by the special interests fully that's they control them hey I have lobbyists I had to tell you I have lobbyists it can produce anything for me they're great but you know what it won't happen it won't happen because we have to stop doing things for some people but for this country it's destroying our country we have to stop and it has to stop now
now our country needs our country needs a truly great leader and we need a truly great leader now we need a leader that wrote the art of the deal we need a leader that can bring back our jobs can bring back our manufacturing can bring back our military can take care of our vets our vets have been abandoned and we also need a cheerleader you know when President Obama was elected I said well the one thing I think he'll do well I
think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country I think he'd be a great spirit he was vibrant he was yeah I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader he's not a leader that's true you're right about that but he wasn't a cheerleader he's actually a negative force he's been a negative force he wasn't a cheerleader he was the opposite we need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again it's not great again
we need we need somebody we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again we can do that and i will tell you i love my life i have a wonderful family they're saying dead you're going to do something that's going to be so tough you know all of my life I've heard that a truly successful person a really really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office just can't happen and yet that's the
kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again so ladies and gentlemen I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again it can happen our country has tremendous potential we have tremendous people we have people that aren't working we are people that have no incentive to work but they're going to have incentive to work because the greatest social program
is a job and they'll be proud and they'll love it and they'll make much more money than they would have ever made and they'll be they'll be doing so well and we're going to be thriving as a country thriving it can happen I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created I tell you that I'll bring back our jobs from China from Mexico from Japan from so many places I'll bring back our jobs and I'll bring back our money right now think of this we owe
china 1.3 trillion dollars we owe Japan more than that so they come in they take our jobs they take our money and then they load us back the money and we pay them an interest and then the dollar goes up so their deals even better how stupid our own leaders how stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen how stupid are they I'm going to tell you thank you i'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade because I'm totally against
the trade bill for a number of reasons number one the people negotiating it don't have a clue our president doesn't have a clue he's a bad negotiator he's the one that did Bergdahl we get Bergdahl they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there we get burg de we get a traitor we get a no-good traitor and they get the five people that they wanted for years and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us that's the
negotiator we have take a look at the deal he's making with Iran he makes that deal Israel maybe won't exist very long it's a disaster and we have to protect Israel but so we need people I'm a free trader but the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you if you don't have talented people if you don't have great leadership if you don't have people that know business not just a political hack that got the job because he made a
contribution to a campaign which is the way all jobs just about our gotten free trade is terrible free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people but we have people that are stupid we have people that aren't smart and we have people that are controlled by special interests and it's just not going to work so here's a couple of stories happen recently a friend of mine is a great manufacturer and you know China comes over and they dump all their stuff
and I buy it i buy it because frankly I have an obligation to buy it because they devalue their currency so brilliantly they just did it recently and nobody thought they could do it again but with all our problems with Russia with all our problems with every everything they got away with it again and it's impossible for our people here to compete so I want to tell you this story friend of mine is a great manufacturer calls me up a few weeks ago
he's very upset I said what's your problem he said you know I make great product and I said I know I know that because i buy the product he said I can't get it into China they won't accept it I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back they talked about environmental they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it I said no wait a minute that's terrible does anyone know this he said yeah they do it all the time with other
people I said they'd send it back yeah so I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff they're not supposed to be doing that I told them now they do charge a tariff on trucks when we send trucks and other things over there ask Boeing they wanted Boeing secrets they wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing hey I'm not saying they're stupid I like China I sell apartment for tent i just sold an
apartment for 15 million dollars to somebody from China am I supposed to dislike them I own a big chunk of the bank of america building in 1290 avenue of the americas that i got from china in a war very valuable I love China the biggest bank in the world is from China you know where they're United States headquarters is located in this building in Trump Tower I love China people say oh you don't like China no I love them but their leaders are much smarter than
our leaders and we can sustain ourselves with that there's too much it's like it's like take the New England Patriots and tom brady and have them play your high school football team that's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders they are ripping us we are rebuilding China we're rebuilding many countries China you go there now roads bridges schools you never saw anything like it they have bridges that make the George Washington
Bridge look like small potatoes and they're all over the place we have all the cards but we don't know how to use them we don't even know that we have the cards because our leaders don't understand the game we could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly now they're going militarily they're building a military island in the middle of the South China Sea a military island now our country could never do that because we'd have to
get environmental clearance and the environmentalists wouldn't let our cut we would never build an ocean they built it in about one year this massive military port they're building up their military to a point that is very scary you have a problem with Isis you have a bigger problem with China and in my opinion the new China believe it or not in terms of trade is Mexico so this man tells me about the manufacturing I say that's a terrible story I hate to hear
but I have another one Ford so Mexico takes a company car company that was going to build in Tennessee rips it out everybody thought the deal was dead reported in The Wall Street Journal recently everybody thought it was a done deal it's going in and that's going to be at going into Tennessee great state great people all of a sudden at the last moment this big car manufacturer foreign announces they're not going to Tennessee they're going to spend their billion
dollars in Mexico instead not good now Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a 2.5 billion dollar car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico 2.5 billion is going to be one of the largest in the world Ford good company so I announced that I'm running for president I would one of the early things I would do probably before I even got in and I wouldn't even use you know I have I know the smartest negotiators in the world I
know the good ones I know the bad ones I know the overrated once you got a lot of that are overrated and not good they think they are they get good stories because the newspapers get buffaloed but they're not good but I know the best negotiators in the world and I'd put him one for each country believe me folks we will do very very well very very well but I wouldn't even waste my time with this way I would call up the header Ford who I know if I was president I'd say
congratulations I understand that you're building a nice 2.5 billion dollar car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero-tax just flow them across the border and you say to yourself how does that help us right how does that help us where is that good it's not so let's say congratulations that's the good news let me give you the bad news every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant
that comes across the border we're going to charge you a thirty-five percent tax okay and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction and that's it now here's what's going to happen if it's not me in the position it's one of these politicians that we're running against you know the 400 people that we're already and here's what's going to happen they're not so stupid they know it's not a good thing and they may even be upset by it but then they're
going to get a call from their donors or probably from the lobbyists for Ford and say you can't do that to Ford because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you and you can't do that to fort and guess what no problem they're going to build in Mexico they're going to take away thousands of jobs it's very bad for us so under president Trump here's what would happen the head of Ford will call me back I would say within an hour after I told him the bad
news but it could be he want to be cool and he'll wait till the next day you know they want to be a little cool and he'll say please please please he'll beg for a little while and i'll say no interest then he'll call all sorts of political people and i'll say sorry fellas no interest because i don't need anybody's money it's nice I don't need anybody's money I'm using my own money I'm not using the lobbyists i'm not using donors i don't care i'm really
rich i'll show you that in a second and by the way I'm not even saying that in a bragging that's the kind of mindset that's the kind of thinking you need for this country so because we got to make the country rich it sounds crass somebody said no that's crass it's not crass we got 18 trillion in debt we got nothing but problems we got a military that needs equipment all over the place we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete we've got nothing we got social security
that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country all these other people want to cut the hell out of it i'm not going to cut it at all I'm going to bring money in and we're going to save it but here's what's going to happen after I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the the donors and by the lobbyists and they have zero chance at convincing me 0 I'll
get a call the next day from the head of Ford they'll say please reconsider I'll say no he'll say mr. president we've decided to move the plant back to the United States we're not going to build it in Mexico that's it they have no choice they have no choice there are hundreds of things like that I'll give you another example Saudi Arabia they make billion dollars a day a billion dollars a day i love the Saudis many are in this
building they make a billion dollars a day whenever they have problems we send over the ship's we said we're going to protect what are we doing they got nothing but money if the right person asked them they pay a fortune they wouldn't be there except for us and believe me you look at the border with Yemen you remember Obama a year ago Yemen was a great victory a great two weeks later the place was blown up everybody got and they kept our equip
they always keep our equipment witness had used equipment right they always keep our equipment we ought to send some real junk because frankly it would be we were to send our surplus we're always losing this gorgeous brand and stuff but look at that border with Saudi Arabia do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen Saudi Arabia without us is gone they're gone and I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq you know all of these
politicians that I'm running against now like it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run if I run I'm running but all of these politicians that I'm running against now they're trying to dis assoc I mean you looked at Busch it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq he couldn't answer the question he didn't know I said is he intelligent then I looked at Rubio he was unable to answer the question is Iraq a good thing or a bad thing he
didn't know he couldn't answer the question how are these people going to lead us how are we gonna how are we going to go back and make it great again we can they don't have a clue they can't lead us they can't they can't even answer simple questions it was terrible but Saudi Arabia is in big big trouble now thanks to fracking and other things the oil is all over the place and I used to say it there are ships at sea and this was during the worst crisis that
were loaded up with oil and the cartel kept the price up because again they were smarter than our ladies they were smarter than Elena's there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again and therefore make it great again because we need money we're dying with dying we need money we have to do it and we need the right people so Ford will come back they'll all come back and I will say this this is going to be an election in
my opinion that's based on competence somebody said thank you darling somebody said to me the other day a report a very nice reporter but mr. Trump you're not a nice person that's true but actually I am I think I am a nice place the people that know me like me does my family like me I think so right look at my family I'm proud of my family by the way speaking of my family Melania Baron cai da need on Vanessa Tiffany evanka did a great job did she do a great job great
Jared Laura and Eric I'm very proud of my family they're great family so the reporter said to me the other day but mr. Trump you're not a nice person how can you get people to vote for you i say i don't know i said i think that number one I am a nice person give a lot of money away to charities and other things I think I'm actually a very nice person but I said this is going to be an election that's based on competence because people are tired of these nice
people and they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world and they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation of the world per capita than any nation in the word and we're 26 in the world 25 countries are better than us at education and some of them are like third-world countries but we're becoming a third world country because of our infrastructure our airports our roads everything so one of the things I did and I said you know
what I'll do I'll do it because a lot of people said he'll never run number one he won't want to give up his lifestyle they're right about that but I'm doing it number 2 i'm a private company so nobody knows what i'm worth and the one thing is that when you run you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth so I said that's okay I'm proud of my net worth I've done an amazing job I started off thank you I started off in a
small office with my father in brooklyn and queens and my father said and i love my father I learned so much he was a great negotiator I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors but I learned a lot but he used to say Donald don't go into manhattan that's the big leagues we don't know anything about that don't do it I said dad I got to go into manhattan I got to build those big buildings I
gotta do it dad I've got to do it and after four or five years in Brooklyn I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals the grand hyatt hotel I was responsible for the convention center on the west side I did a lot of great deals and I did him early and young and now I'm building all over the world and I love what I'm doing but they all said a lot of the pundits on television well Donald will never run and what are the main reasons is he's private and he's
probably not as successful as everybody thinks so I said to myself you know nobody's ever going to know unless I run because I'm really proud of my success I really am I've employed I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime that means medical that means education that means everything so a large accounting firm in my accountants have been working for months because it's big and complex and they put together a
statement a financial statement this is a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government and we don't need extensions or anything we'll be filing it right on time we don't need anything and it was even reported incorrectly yesterday because they said he had assets of nine billion so it's known as the wrong number that's the wrong number not assets so they put together this and before I say it I have to say this I made it the old fashioned
with real estate you know it's realistic it's labor and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions and it's all over the place and building all over the world and I have assets big accounting firm one of the most highly respected nine billion 240 million dollars and I have liabilities of about 500 that's long term debt very low interest rates fact one of the big banks came to me said Donald you don't have enough borrowings could we loan you
four billion dollars i said i don't need it I don't want it and I've been there I don't want it but in two seconds they give me whatever i wanted so i have a total net worth and now with the increase it will be well over ten billion dollars but here a total net worth of eight billion net worth not assets not liability a net worth after all debt after all expenses the greatest assets of Trump Tower 12 I in the avenue of the americas bank of
america building in San Francisco Forty wall street sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the New York said many other places all over the world so the turtle is eight billion 737 million five hundred and forty thousand dollars now I'm not doing that I'm not doing that to brag because you know what I don't have to break I don't have to believe it or not I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs we need that thinking we
have the opposite thinking we have losers we have losers we have people that don't have it we have people that are morally corrupt we have people that are selling this country down the drain so I put together the statement and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going because if we have another three or four years you know where an 18 trillion now we're soon going to be at 20 trillion according to The Economist
so I'm not big believers in but nevertheless this is what they're saying that 24 trillion were very close that's the point of no return 24 trillion dollars we will be there soon that's when we become Greece that's when we become a country that's unsalvageable and we're going to be there very soon we're going to be there very soon so just to sum up I would do various things very quickly I would repeal and replace the big lie Obamacare
I would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me believe me and I'll build them very inexpensively I will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have Mexico pay for that wall mark my words nobody would be tougher on Isis than Donald Trump nobody i will find within our military I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur I will find the right guy I will find the guy that's going to take that military and
make it really work nobody nobody will be pushing us around I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons and we won't be using a man like secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation who's making a horrible and laughable deal who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old and falls and breaks his leg I won't be doing that and I promise I will never be in a bicycle race that i can
tell you i will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration immediately fully support and backup the Second Amendment now it's very interesting today I heard it through stupidity in a very very hardcore prison interestingly named Clinton two vicious murders two vicious people escaped and nobody knows where they are and a woman was on television this morning and she said you know mr. Trump and she was telling other people
and I actually called her but she said you know mr. Trump I always was against guns I didn't want guns and now since this happened it's up in the prison area my husband and I are finally an agreement because he wanted the guns we now have a gun on every table we're ready to start shooting I said very interesting so protect the Second Amendment end end Common Core Common Core should it is a disaster Bush is totally in favor of Common Core I
don't see how he can possibly get the nomination he's weak on immigration he's in favor of Common Core how to hell can you vote for this guy you just can't do it we have to end education has to be local reap the country's infrastructure nobody can do that like me believe me it will be done on time on budget way below cost way below what anyone ever thought I look at these roads being built all over the country and I say I can build those things for one-third what they do
is unbelievable how bad you know we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue the old post office we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels going to be the best hotel in Washington DC we got it from the general services administration in Washington the Obama administration we got it it was the most highly sought after all one of them but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services we got it people were shocked
Trump got it well i got it for two reasons number one we're really good number two we had a really good plan and i'll add in the third we had a great financial statement because the General Services who are terrific people by the way and talented people they wanted to do a great job and they want to make sure it got built so we have to rebuild our infrastructure our bridges our roadways our airports you come into laguardia airport it's like we're in a
third world country you look at the patches in the 40 year old floor they throw down asphalt and they throw you look at these airports we are like a third-world country and I come in from China and I come in from guitar and I come in from different places and they have the most incredible airports in the world you come back to this country and you have LAX disaster you have all of these disasters airports we have to rebuild our infrastructure
save Medicare Medicaid and Social Security without cuts have to do it get rid of the fraud get rid of the waste and abuse but save it people have been paying in four years and now many of these candidates want to cut it you save it by making the United States by making us rich again by taking back all of the money that's being lost renegotiate our foreign trade deals reduce our 18 trillion in debt because believe me we're in a bubble we have artificially
low interest rates we have a stock market that frankly it's been good to me but i still hate to see what's happening we have a stock market that is so bloated be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens so be very very careful and strengthen our military and take care of our vets so so important sadly the American Dream is dead but if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and
stronger than ever before and we will make America great again thank you thank you very much Thank
