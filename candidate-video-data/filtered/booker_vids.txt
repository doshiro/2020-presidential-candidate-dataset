American city right now it's proud to have you on what it amounts to my front lawn but in many ways it's right up this street that my career started in politics was a bunch of tenant leaders who were perhaps I always say I got my BA from Stanford but my PhD on the streets of Newark it was a bunch of tenant leaders that pushed me into running for office because they really believed that was the best way to make a
difference in this neighborhood I've long since believed that life is about purpose and not position and I started to stay true to the purpose that brought me into politics in the first place it's why if you're in my office in Washington it's a map of this neighborhood that sits behind me in my desk to focus on the folks who first took a chance on me and put me into the game and what my neighbors are concerned with and I've heard all around the country is that
people in America are losing faith that this nation will work for them they're beginning to believe that that too many folks are going to get left out or left behind they beginning to believe that the forces that are tearing us apart are stronger than the forces that bond us together as a people as a country I'm running for president because I want to address these issues we are a nation the story of who we are everybody who's gathered on my front
walk here we are all here because Americans from different backgrounds different races different religions even different political parties stood together work together fought together to make this country stand for something what makes us unique and different is that we have folks from all over the planet Earth from Eastern Europe to Asia from Western Europe to Africa who DNA is now on this soil and by us working together we did things that other people
thought were impossible my parents generation knew that if we came together blacks and whites Christians and Jews we can up and Jim Crow we used to be a people that can point into the sky and look at the moon and change it from a dream to a to a destiny there's no Republican or democratic way to get there you definitely don't get there if I fightin each other beating each other down and dividing people against themselves we did those things because
we found our common ground now this is not easy it's a tough work of building a great community or what King called the Beloved Community it's hard to do that but it's about time we get to the hard work of building this nation to be who we want us to be our best values our best ideals the best of who we are we need leadership in this country that understands what patriotism means and patriotism is love of country and you can't love your country unless
you love your fellow countrymen and women doesn't mean we're always gonna agree or somedays always like each other but we gotta extend each other grace less judgment and more hard work to find common ground to do the things that other people on the planet earth don't think we can do we're a nation that leads and we've got to get back to doing that together so I'm happy to answer any questions you all want but I'm grateful seriously grateful to have you all in
Newark for those of you who only passed through our airport take some time to the downtown and see the new buildings we've built new hotels go up the street see the new supermarket we put in place see the schools that are now ranked Frank us as the number one city in America for beat the odds schools high poverty high performance we're doing great things my old friend and after this I'm gonna tell you to get off love they see that love alone and they wonder
well I called on crews first because when I was mayor he gave me my most difficult questions I started start with hardest first look you know love and easy and our history in this country there's some of the toughest most heroic people that I admire whose pictures hang in my office who statues are in the Capitol there folks that took on armed hate billy clubs and dogs and fire hose with unarmed love and they took down jim crow their folks like a great New Jersey
and Alice Paul who loved this country so much she was willing to demand that it live up to its promise she was the first person ever arrested in front of the White House because she refused to let people in power undermine the power of the people the rights of women the people I admire are the people that Levi's calling out the best of who we are not the worst so I'm running for president because I believe in us I believe in these values
I'm gonna put them before the American people hey and if that's not what they want then I won't be the next president United States but I know my country I know the goodness and the decency across this land I've experienced it my family I'm in New Jersey because of that decency of white families who would not let my parents be denied housing because of the color of their skin that's the kind of patriotism that's the kind of love my family's experience I know it
exists in our country I believe in it I'm putting my faith in that message that heart and that reality in America it's a lot of people in New Jersey are gonna sit and look at this and say you know we have another guy who ran for president four years ago and we spent a lot of time not doing his job how do you convince people that you can run a campaign and yet not make the same mistakes that Chris Christie made look at the voters of New Jersey put their
faith in me and I will never ever let them down I'm gonna continue to be an active force in the Senate and at a time of cynicism in Washington heck if you just look at the last Congress at a time that people don't believe Washington can get big things done in the last Congress alone I was able to work across the aisle with my partners and get big pieces of legislation done you know the system of mass incarceration in this nation is a shame to a nation that is
the land of the free and I with working with others pass the first bill that finally takes a real crack and ending mass incarceration even something I realized that capital in this country is lazy doesn't invest in fact about five cities have the overwhelming majority of investment capital going there I passed I wrote legislation with a Republican across the aisle that now is law and is going to get hundreds of billions of dollars finally invested
into the lowest income areas creating many many jobs so I know I can do my job as a senator I've been showing that and I also know that I can answer the call what I believe my country is right now which is leadership that's gonna bring us together and not try to rip us apart well well I'm grateful that New Jerseyans pulled together to make sure that that that possibility is there but my focus is running for president in the
United States and I will be running hard and and going directly to the people hand to hand shaking hands knocking on doors in many ways the way I started my career Ron is running for City Council I'm going out to the people and I intend to be the next president United States three quick questions you're a greedy guy even even Cruz over here who used to badger me even countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care so now
the filibuster is a decision that's made in the Senate my colleagues and I everybody I've talked to believe that the legislative filibuster should stay there and I will personally resist efforts to get rid of them you know anybody who knows my history knows that my history is standing up for people that are awful often being hurt by bad actors I lived in Newark during the mortgage crisis I saw the predatory loans where
people were luring people into homes who had no jobs and no income and they gave him cash at closing my record as a mayor my record as a senator is fighting those interests are trying to screw people and when it comes to defending folks I will be ferocious yes in the back let's be clear whatever you do when you're in elected office you're gonna get criticized you know when I was before I would got into elected office when I helped somebody
cross the street people said I was a really nice guy now when I help somebody across the street there's somebody standing back and saying oh he's just trying to get a vote there's a lot of understandable cynicism out there and I feel like the best way to do that is with your actions I believe we are a great nation because we have stuck up for each other and we've got to stop bad actors from taking advantage of people it happens I see it in in the changes
that have been made to allow credit card companies to my opinion overcharge I fought overdraft fee's as a senator I can go through the things I've done to hold people accountable and I think we need a lot of change from our tax laws making them more fair to ending things like carried interest I'm gonna continue being the person I've always been despite the criticism in fact as my mom was joking with me last night son of you're not being criticized
you're probably not doing that much well again this is what we have is people for political purposes trying to not talk about what they're for but talk about what they're against new workers and I think people in cities all across America are tired of people that are putting that putting down our urban spaces making trying to make them into jokes ridicule and demeaning them integrating them my time here in New York during the worst economy of my
lifetime we did things that other people thought were impossible to do we assured in New York's biggest economic development period in 60 years building our new first new office towers and our first new hotel is putting new workers to work constructing them in New Yorkers to work in those buildings we brought supermarkets to food deserts we improved our public schools to a level now in fact if you are black kid in Newark which is our majority of our
schools your chances of going to a high-performing school that beats the suburbs one of three hundred percent and perhaps the best thing to say to anybody who wants to criticize my leadership in Newark when I left Newark for the first time in 60 years our population was growing again people were moving here because of our schools moving here because of our arts and entertainment moving here because they weren't interested in tearing down this city
they wanted to be a part of the city's what's your reaction are you you know anything you do there's gonna be competition bring it I believe in the American people I think they're gonna look to the Democratic Party for leadership I believe that we are going to consolidate in this country against the politics of hate politics of division I think that people are taught tired of the demeaning and are ready for some redeeming to reclaim ideals of
civic grace and decency and so I'm gonna run a kind of campaign where I'm not focused on who else is in the race when I was a high hurdler and Alta pan high school my coach told me don't look to the right look left run your race and that's what I intend to do muchas gracias a la comunidad athena porque in me campaña en la ciudad en la comunidad latina no no no - de una victoria grande en el futuro EMPs por todo es un pius confit Esperanza vamos a tener un país
mas Grande mejor por todo so con la comunidad latina parte de la comunidad americano vamos a tener una victoria grande no por una can idato para por nuestro pies los immigrant a's SI un pase de immigrant A's assume pius es más fuerte porque tenemos personas en la popa este are ready doyle al mundo necesito mas emigration and boy are lucha para cada in case Todd would throw pikes we're going to way back here to the dude with
the hat behind the TMZ camera cuz I am literally not not looking forward to him and asking me a question go ahead well first and foremost our teachers are ridiculously underpaid in America if you just want to look at this in an economic analysis they are the profession that contributes the most to a thriving American economy and we can not continue to devalue what is one of the greatest professions in our country which is public schoolteachers hermana ha ha ha I
love Victoria I'm sorry about that I'm sorry but this is really important I'm going to run the boldest probe public school teacher campaign there is because well how I how I governed when I was mayor of the City of Newark we fought to get PE teachers here in the city increased pay increased respect better access to technology and by the way when we talk about schools let's not just talk about being there for teachers but also for councilors our schools do not
have enough counselors mental health professionals our schools need more supportive environments our schools should be more than just schools but cathedrals of learning where we support our children I believe in public education I am a product of public education and as a senator I I've invested my time and effort working with teachers groups around this country I'm Cory Booker and I ran for Senate and got the endorsement of our state's teachers
unions I'm proud of my record it's not enough anything needed to defend I believe that we shouldn't have one-size-fits-all education local leaders should make decisions about what works best for them and if you're a kid in Newark what we've created double-digit increases in our graduation rate readings in math and it was done by who by public school teachers I can't believe we live in a country and this is the absurdity of it all we're a 25 year
old stockbroker pays less than a percentage of their income in taxes or gets better tax breaks than a 50 year old teacher who reaches in their pocket to pay for food or or sanitary products or clothing for their kids we need to start having a tax code in this country that reflects our values as a people everybody understands that we can't be a leading nation without leading the world in education we need to get back to that public
education I'm gonna go to the person in the back jumping up and down oh yeah it's one how you doing man I can't see you underneath all that hat egde well first of all I just want everybody to know I miss Obama and I miss her husband too look I I had I've had conversations with Obama in the past god bless him and and and I'm really grateful for the kind of leadership he provided this country I got to in fact but first one of the
first things I did on the day I was sworn in by Joe Biden as a as United States Senator was he invited me to the Oval Office and we sat and had a heart-to-heart and he gave me some of the best advice I could get as to become a senator in fact that day the best advice I got in my early days rather was from John McCain and from President Barack Obama about what it meant to be a state's person to put patriotism but before petty personal attacks so we've
been blessed to have great leaders in this country especially our ancestors who we should be honoring now there are no statues built to haters there are no statues well I shouldn't say that there's some stat maybe some statues unfortunately there are but we honor people at their funerals that we've seen a recent for their grace and for their decency and for their selfless service and we need to get back to elevating those kind of folks and they're not
always people with titles as I learned here in Newark the greatest leaders I've ever met aren't in white houses or sentence or Congress's or or what have you there are people in communities neighbors who are strong on blocks tenant leaders who hold folks together the greatness of this country lies and our ability to be there for each other to extend grace and kindness and we need to start having a better celebration of those values in our nation especially
and hopefully reflected in the people we elect our highest offices on the last question yes sir I don't know the I don't know the I don't know the heart of anybody I'll leave that to the Lord I know there are a lot of people who profess the ideology of white supremacy that use his words and I believe his failure to condemn bigotry and racism I believe that when he makes comments about African countries when he
challenges and demeans the ability of a federal judge to do their job because of their ancestry that's bigoted language and there's no way around that but I just want everybody to know I'm I'm I'm gonna run a race about not who I'm against or what I'm against both but who I'm for and what I'm for I'm not looking even to too simplistically to beat Republicans no I'm looking to unite Americans in this race because I believe we have more in
common than divides us I believe that this reflexive partisanship is undermining our ability to find common ground and get common-sense things done we right now agree on enough to make big changes in America to drive down health care costs to drive up student achievement to fix our infrastructure to provide better education to make us safer and stronger and more prosperity for a more prosperous and so I'm really excited over the coming months to put my
ideas before the American people and I know that I have confidence in them but the other thing I'm going to be trying to do over these next month's is to just appeal to what I know is the goodness and the decency of Americans and we've got to stop that trash-talking twitter trolling tearing folks down this is a time for all of us to think about our role in putting the indivisible back in in this one nation under God what's that I definitely can and I'm gonna let this
be the last question and I'm sorry and then I'll go up but this is really important bringing people together means we should be uncompromising and talking about justice and holding people accountable I really worry that right now we have a country that has such appalling levels of injustice right now there are over a thousand jurisdictions in America where kids have more than twice the blood lead levels than Flint Michigan
here in Newark down in Camden kids are drinking out of bottled water because of the lead in their pipes we have a nation where there's hundreds of places where it seems to be easier to find unleaded gasoline than unleaded water and a lot of this is not about pointing fingers we all have to start taking responsibility because it seems like we're more eager to do something but like giving tax cuts to corporations that weren't even asking for the level of tax cuts we gave as
opposed to investing in the infrastructure that would keep our children safe and strong the most valuable natural resources country has is not oil or gas or coal it's the genius of our children if we're gonna compete in a 21st century knowledge-based economy we should all be morally outraged outraged that so many of our children's minds be addled by lead levels that that should tear at the heart of all of us and so my I this is
what got me into politics when I when I started out that the central Ward of Newark was having a lead crisis because of lead paint at that time but even we stand here right now we have Superfund sites that are that are within us just a few miles of where we stand and we now know from Princeton data that children being born around Superfund sites he's the highly toxic sites in our country have 20% or significantly higher rates of autism significantly higher rates of
birth defects and what's happening with these toxic Superfund sites in our country because of literally Reagan and Mitch McConnell which all voted for Reagan reauthorized a small tax on the most polluting companies but yet in this era of people saying that we don't want any new taxes those those those small taxes have lapsed I've pushed for them in the Senate since I got there and what's happened to Superfund sites are on this country we've seen more of them
they've actually increased putting our children at risk I'm sorry it's it's easy to say I love America but love is not a word it is a his action is sacrifice in his work and and and if we're allowing our children to fall prey to lead or toxic sites with this rampant environmental justice that we see from the black belt of center of the south to the to the Great Lakes area it casts a shadow over all of us and so we need to come together now enough
enough of this politics that were just tearing each other down that seems to be the end unto itself we have a greater calling than that to elevate our children to take care of the elderly I'll be there for each other that's when we are a great nation that's when we do things that other people say they can't be done and that's what my presidential campaign will be about and if this country sees fit to elect me president the United States that's what my
leadership will be about thank you you
hello Nevada so um hello Nevada look Mike my even my supporters we got to behave yourself because my mom is here right now I'm proud that my mom isn't a dad and I'm a proud that my grandparents lived in Nevada and I tell you this my dad died here it was during my primary to become a United States Senator my father had a stroke and went to a hospital right here in Las Vegas and I was distressed my mom told me don't leave
the primary it's days before it he's in the hospital he's stable I'm going to be with him and I will never forget I'm competing in a primary to become a United States Senator but I'll never forget getting a call from a man named Harry Reid Harry told me stay on the trail I will go and be with your mom Harry Reid did not know me but he went to the hospital he sat with my mom and when Harry Reid comes in the hospital folk respond I want you to know that my
dad's quality of care from these incredible professionals was already great but it got a little greater my dad then died six days before I was elected to the United States Senate Harry was one of those early calls to me when I got to the Senate there were two people I saw before I stood before Joe Biden to be sworn in on the floor of the United States Senate and the first my mom took me because she knew the void in my heart that my dad was gone but she
took me to see John Lewis who was so humble was so moving was telling me what it meant to him to see the fourth black person ever elected to the United States Senate this is what he said he fought for and stood for and then I left and I went to Harry Reid's office and he hugged me and he told me you will be a great senator and then he sent me out to the floor of the United States Senate where I got sworn in by Joe I'll never
forget my mom's words that day she goes son as we were walking from John Lewis to Harry Reid she was going off on me I don't know if any senator ever got sworn in with a mother lecturing them the entire way but my mom's like boy never forget what had to get to get you here never forget the sacrifices and the struggles don't forget boy remember that the title doesn't make the man the man has got to make the title well I want to I want to
tell you tonight there are a lot of candidates in this race but I want to tell you that I am running not just because I stand with my colleagues on believing that health care should be a right I stand with my colleagues and understanding that we have to meet the existential crisis of climate change I stand with my colleagues and know that a system of mass incarceration and a nation that professes freedom is obscene and objectively wrong
but I want to tell you right now I am running for president of the United States not because of him not because of one man in one office not because of his moral vandalism we don't win as Democrats when we run races about simply what we're against we win them when we talk about what we're for and who we're for and how we fight and so tonight I want to tell you I'm running for president because I believe in us this is a moral moment in America don't
let anybody tell you otherwise it's not about left or right it is about right or wrong it is about the character of our country and we as Democrats now we have to understand that the objective we have yeah we want to win elections we want to send Mitch McConnell to the backbench we want to get a new president but we're not running on the short-term political goal of beating Republicans we must run on the larger goal of uniting Americans again because we're a nation where we
even agree on things 90% of Americans agree on common-sense gun safety regulation but we don't even get the things done we agree on this is a moral moment because here we are in America who were the first generation of our life expectancy going down where we say we love our children but every other competitor global industrialized nation has universal prenatal care but we lead with infant mortality maternal mortality that we say we're the home of the brave
when our veterans when they come home are disproportionately homeless that we say we believe in liberty and justice for all but we are a nation that treats you better as my friend Bryan Stevenson says if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent this is an election where we have to see in this race it's about having a revival of civic grace it's about having a more crazy is empathy for one another it is
remembering that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women and love is not sentimentality it's not weak and anemic love is what you see and how Harry Reid led his life standing for people being there in the clutch love is what got people the storm beaches in Normandy together it's what had people when they tried to beat us down in Stonewall or push us back in Selma had us clinging together not
turning against each other but turning to each other not picking up arms but joining arms and standing and marching and fighting for a better America I'm running for president of United States because I believe in us I believe heard were a better nation when we put more indivisible into this one nation under God I believe that the lines that divide us are not as strong as the ties that bind us and let me tell you this right now we need radical change but every
generation has had it but remember how we made that radical change some people say to me Cory you know you're not gonna beat Donald Trump with love and I tell them right away I'm the guy that has a movie about him called street fight oscar-nominated I'm the guy that took on a political machine you can fight with a ferocity but without being cruel you can fight with strength without being me you can lift folks up without tearing others down
this is a moral moment we will not beat Donald Trump by being more Trumpy we must beat his darkness with our light we must beat his hate with our love and this is we gotta remember too that the candidate we must choose must be the antidote to what King said where he said the problem today is not just the vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people is the appalling silence and inaction of the good people our next nominee has got to be the best person to
inspire us to common cause to get us off the sidelines to remember the democracy's a verb I'm running because I know whether you're suburban or rural black or Latino that I could be the next leader to ignite this country to remember not just that we need to fight but why we fight and so I ask everybody right now to remember why we fight we fight for our children we fight for those who may not pray like us or look like us but they are just as American as
us we fight because we know that we are all in this together that our founders as imperfect as they were ended the Declaration of Independence with a declaration of interdependence they said that we must if we're going to make it as a nation mutually pledge pledge to each other Our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred honor we fight to revive those ideals in our country at a time that someone is torching them but let me tell you I don't care how many
people try to tear us down or history speaks that we are a nation that has always responded by coming together and rising up and now it's time again that is that moment in history again that we must join together in a chorus and say we will rise we will rise for health care for all we will rise for public schools and public education we will rise for the mentally ill and the homeless we will rise for economic justice we will rise
for our unions let us remember that we Democrats come from a great stock when the Russians beat us to Sputnik and the air was Sputnik we didn't tear each other apart we joined together with hidden figures together with white astronauts and we went to the moon we come from Kennedy who pointed to the moon King who pointed to a mountaintop and said we will rise we when they pushed us back in Selma and they tried to stop it as in Stonewall we said we
will rise with Donald Trump in the White House he may try to tear us down but in this next election we will rise and I'll tell you this to end with the great words of a poet Donald Trump may try to demean and degrade and divide but we will answer him with the hearts and our spirits and our courage and grit and love and as that poet said he may try to write us down in history with his bitter twisted lies he may try to trot us down in the very dirt but America like dust
like courage like our ancestors we will rise thank you Nevada thank you for your love thank you for your decency and your kindness thank you please welcome to the stage mayor Pete Buda judge
hello everybody I am so grateful to be here and I want to start with a counterintuitive statement there is this mistake people make about presidential elections and we've heard it from somebody who I won't mention who says only I can solve all the problems we have to remember how change is made it wasn't a whole bunch of fellas and the early 1900's who gathered together on the Senate floor and said it's about
time those women have the right to vote that's not how it happened it wasn't Strom Thurmond coming to the Senate floor and saying I have seen the light those Negro people should have some civil rights no change does not come from Washington it comes to Washington by people who fight for it and to struggle for it and organize for it I began my career in the streets of Newark New Jersey as a twenty-something
organizing tenants who often had been iced felt isolated and separated by slum Lords who were not providing safe decent sanitary housing and we beat them because the power of the people of the power of the people is always greater than the people in power and so you all are here not because of an individual candidate in this election season can't be just about an individual office we have to talk about the deeper dissatisfaction in our country because
of the anti-democratic forces you all are here because I know you joined my feeling to be dissatisfied that we live in a nation as my friend Brian Stevenson says that has a criminal justice system that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent you all are dissatisfied like me that we live in a nation where millions of children find it easier to get unleaded gasoline than unleaded water you all are like me that you're
dissatisfied that in this great nation we have millions of people who work full-time jobs but dignity has been stripped of the work a tax on Union and you have more and more Americans now finding themselves with more month at the end of their money than money at the end of their you all just satisfied that we live a nation with the growth of corporate power has gotten so much that they are now finding ways as they have in the
past to publicize the costs on society and privatize their profits now everything I just mentioned was going on before Donald Trump was elected we have to be serious about what's happening I'm traveling all over the country now and I see from Iowa to South Carolina that it's not just about who's president state legislators legislators are attacking public education straight legislators like we see are attacking the right to organize and States this
period in American history has to be about more than just one office and one person it has to be that moral moment in our nation like the civil rights movement where you expand the consciousness of our country and return the power in this nation to the people and power concedes nothing without a demand we must organize we must fight and even after election day in 2020 whoever is president and whoever the Democratic nominee all of us must line
up in solidarity behind them and when we win that office fact that office holder must lead the greatest grassroots organizing efforts we ever seen to secure in this nation again a country where public education is fully funded to secure in this nation where we have a criminal justice system that is not known for jailing the mentally ill jailing the addicted jailing the poor but is about restorative justice about empowering people we've got to return to
a nation with the favours unions and gives them the power they need to organize and to grow and not shrink and decrease we need presidents that are going to organize for our rural brothers and sisters living in communities that are being hollowed out and disinvested this has got to be a different kind of election because there's too many of our brothers and sisters that are hurting I live in an amazing city in an amazing unity I'm proud to be the only one in
this election living in a black and brown inner-city neighborhood and right now the median income is below the poverty line I see my neighbors who work full-time jobs but still need food stamps at her local bodega shahad Smith who I lived with in the projects for almost ten years was murdered with an assault rifle at the top of my block I live in a country where black men like me were six percent of the nation's population but we make up over half of
all the homicide victims in this country we live in a nation right now that if you're born in communities like mine this deck is stacked against you we have got to make this a nation with a dream and the ideals of this country work for every American where we live up to our ideals and all men and women are created equal where the oath we pledge are not just words from our mouths but a reality in America that we are a nation of liberty and justice for all and so I'm
looking forward to answer your questions but for me I'm not running for president because of an office or position for me life is always about purpose and not position I got into politics as a central Ward councilman because of communities like mine too many people being left out too many people being left aside we must be about the purpose of this nation the dream of this country I am fighting to run for president because I think we can reignite that
dream again bigger than any individual and that's where I want to end I want to challenge everyone and I'm excited about answering your questions but we are next week under to get the 51st anniversary of this slot of the murder of Martin Luther King in Memphis and if you go there to Memphis Tennessee and you look down right there at the MER Lorraine Motel you are gonna see words from Scripture that are a challenge to future generations they're the words that
Joseph's brothers uttered when they saw him and his coat of many colors that dream interpreter and they grabbed him and they threw him into the well to die well there are many Americans now that feel isolated in a well if you like the promise of this country ring hollow with their experiences the question is will we be like Joseph who went from the pit to the palace and so right there were Martin Luther King shot have some words that
Joseph's brothers uttered when they saw Joseph in the desert and the first time I read them I took them as a challenge to us right where King was slain what are those words it says behold here cometh the dreamer let us slay him and see what becomes of his dream what will become of the dream of America well I tell you right now it is time for this generation to dream again it is time for us to reclaim and reinvigorate the dream it's time for us to dream again of a
nation that every child has a great public school to go to it's time for us to dream again that every family has healthcare that it's universal for all it's time for us to dream again that work has dignity and all can retire with security it's time for us to dream again bold dreams and defiant dreams and daring dreams and the humble dreams of America and if we stand together and work together and dream together I promise you that this
election will be more than just taking one person out of office this will be the beginning of the next era of America where dreams are not just words or songs but a reality for all thank you yeah
well thank you for being here this morning before we get go any further let us take a moment of reflection for the families in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio who are grieving and instead of celebrating life they are now in the midst of planning funerals for their loved ones so if we could just for a few moments thank you now am I welcome you to mother Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church a place that has taken the stance against the injustice of slavery a place that has taken a stance against Jim Crow a place that has taken a stance against segregation a place that has taken a stance and always takes his stance against hatred a place where over four years ago nine people's lives were taken at the hand of a white supremacist it is a place that continues to take a stand against hatred and racism and gun
violence and white supremacy against injustice and bigotry it's a place of forgiveness and healing a place of love strength and courage mother Emanuel knows all too well what it means to suffer at the hands of hatred and white supremacy and bigotry and today again unlike any other day we need leaders to stand against gun violence by supporting the bills that are out there we need leaders to speak out against hatred bigotry racism and we always welcome
leaders who are able and who are ready to do just that so today we welcome a leader who was doing just that and gives me great pleasure to introduce and to present senator Cory Booker thank you it's good to see everyone this morning and good morning to you I want to thank Reverend Manning for opening his sanctuary today we're here this morning in the wake of yet another act of hatred in America but I come here today because of love the kind of love I learned about
in church growing up the kind of courageous love of people who could love those who hated them who despised and cursed them a heroic love that pushed people to March knowing they could be beaten to board buses knowing that they could be bombed to join with others to sit in knowing that they could be dragged to the ground kicked and spit and sent to jails and hospitals a love fueled by multiracial multi-ethnic coalition's that share a commitment to
the common cause and singular destiny of this nation a radical love that rejects the sinister and dangerous delusion of other Ness a delusion that divides that weakens that pits American against American to our own collective peril the kind of love this kind of love is a love that demands honesty because we all know in both our public and our private lives that real love demands the truth it requires us to admit when we are wrong to be vulnerable about our mistakes and
our contradictions and to be willing to question what we sometimes hold sacred this is a lesson I have learned over and over again in my own life with my own for lt''s and to love our country in this moment means that we have to step outside of our comfort zones and confront that which is in ourselves this is a moment that calls for us to ask hard questions and genuinely then seek the answers we need to be honest about not just who we are but who we have been
for generations and generations in this nation and that means we go back to the beginning and we need to acknowledge that the very founding of our country was an act of profound contradiction those who sought the most profound and glorious freedom in so many ways for so many people also perpetuated the very opposite bigotry was written into our founding documents Native Americans in our Declaration of Independence referred to as savages in our Constitution black
people are fractions of human beings white supremacy has always been a problem in our American story if not always at the surface then lurking not so far beneath it we've seen it from slave masters who stole and pillaged black bodies for profit to demagogues throughout generations who stoked racist and anti-immigrant hatred often for votes and then enshrined this bigotry into our laws and yes racist violence has always been a part of the American
story never more so than in times of transition and times of rapid social change we have seen it from the Civil War to the civil rights movement from the web summer of a hundred years ago to Charlottesville from the lynching of people of Mexican descent in Porvenir Tech 101 years ago to the massacre targeting Latin X people in El Paso Texas this past Saturday to say this is to speak the truth plainly because without the
truth there can be no reconciliation James Baldwin wrote in the fire next time that it is the innocence which constitutes the crime silence in the face of these in justices is a choice to be passive is to be complicit to ignore hate is to empower it it is to fall back on that easy false virtue of tolerance to probably claim that we are a nation of tolerance is no great aspiration tolerance suggests that if you disappear off the
face of the earth I would be no better or worse off because I was just tolerating you and your difference like I tolerate a cold or a headache we are not called to tolerate injustice we are called to combat it we are not called to tolerate each other we are called to love one another so we must acknowledge as a country that as much as white supremacy manifests manifests itself in dangerous and deadly acts of terror it is perpetrated by what is too often a
willful ignorance or dangerous tolerance of its presence in our society it manifests itself in a criminal justice system that arrests blacks at three times the rate of whites for drug-related crimes despite virtually no difference between whites and blacks in the frequency of dealing or using drugs it manifests itself in an immigration system that targets Latin X migrants fleeing violence and allows us to see them so much as the other that whedon
humanize them we separate families we put children in cages nursing women or pregnant women on concrete floors it manifests itself in a health care system that disproportionately fails black and brown Americans that dismisses the pain of black women with deadly consequences and we're undocumented people in our nation are afraid to seek care in a crisis because they fear deportation and the twisted irony of this poison is its
corrosive it hurts the very people it actually even claims to represent think about this that white supremacy allows political leaders to promise to build the wall while not building hospitals schools or infrastructure critical for the success of all Americans it talks about the invasion of immigrants while allowing the deadly opioids to invade our communities kill our children lower the life expectancy of Americans and white men in particular and it creates a
dangerous delusion that song amongst us or outside our moral concern that we don't have to care about those others we don't have to think about them that they should express their gratitude simply to be here an idea that some Americans can even be a threat to other Americans just by existing when in reality the story of America the truth of our nation is that we share a common cause a common purpose that there is only one singular American destiny as a political strategy
weaponizing hatred can be effective it often seems easy Islamophobia anti-semitism homophobia xenophobia misogyny these tactics aren't a new perversion of our politics they've been ingrained and our politics since our founding generations of politicians have used fear of the other for political gain and that is certainly the case today hate crimes in America are increasing anti-semitism and Islamophobia are on
the rise the majority of terrorist attacks in this country since 9/11 have been perpetrated by right-wing extremists here at home and the majority of those have been white supremacists and these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum they are harvested only once they have been planted Galatians reads do not be deceived God is not mocked for whatever a man shows this he will also reap you reap what you sow the ant act of anti-latino anti-immigrant
hatred we witnessed this past weekend did not start with the hand that pulled the trigger it did not begin when a single white supremacist got into his car to travel ten hours to kill as many human beings as he could it was planted in fertile soil because the contradictions that have shadowed this country since its founding remain a part of our body politic it was sowed by those who spoke the same words the el paso murderer did
warning of an invasion it was sold by those who spoke of an infestation of disgusting cities rats and rodents talking about majority minority communities it was sold by those who've drawn an equivalence between neo-nazis and those who protest them it was sold from the highest office in our land we see in tweets and rhetoric hateful words that ultimately endanger the lives of people in our country people of color immigrants of us all but let's be clear
our work is not complete by calling out the shortcomings of our leaders it is harder but it is necessary to recognize the decisions we collectively make every day that perpetrate this dangerous reality each person each generation has a decision to make do you want to combat or do you want to contribute to our collective advancement or through inaction or worse to our collective retrenchment do you want to contribute to our progress or
through apathy and indifference to the violence that threatens to tear us asunder that is the challenge of our generation today it is the collective crossroads we are at people's very lives are in the balance and to be frank the future of our country hangs in the balance the character and the culture of who we are hangs in the balance this is the crossroads which is why we can't let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who is or isn't a
racist because of the answer to the question to racism and white supremacy exist is yes then the real question isn't who is or isn't a racist but who is and isn't doing something about it this is a question that has a deep moral resonance it's not enough to say I'm not a racist we must be anti racism because there's no neutrality in this fight you are either an agent of justice or you are contributing to the problem addressing this and we must understand
this addressing this is not an act of charity or philanthropy it is an issue of national security it is an issue of patriotism is issue of love and we can't begin to express that love unless we have a real conversation that we need to be first change in a loss dr. King once said that I quote it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me it may be true that the law cannot
change the heart but it can restrain the heartless we have the power to act and we can't act to legislate safety even if we cannot legislate love we must act to prevent people who should not have guns from getting them and that includes Congressman Jim Clyburn edge' slay Shinto close the loophole that enabled one man to take nine Souls from this very congregation we must act to get the weapons of war off our streets out of our grocery
stores our bars our temples and our churches and our schools by banning assault weapons once and for all and and look this is common sense we've done it for cars we can do it for guns we must require federal licensing for guns in America it is a common-sense policy and one that we know from the evidence and the data will actually save lives and we've got to go further we must require that the Department of Justice Homeland Security and the FBI
conduct assessments of the domestic terrorist threats that are posed by white supremacists to take this more seriously to act on the threat and to publicly and transparently report annually to Congress and the public on these threats we must require the FBI to dramatically change and improve reporting of hate crimes and work with local law enforcement to establish policies to to focus on training to focus on how to identify and investigate
and report these crimes that threaten our security and safety with chilling regularity we must change our laws but I can repeat we must also confront our past the truth is there is another story we can tell about our country a better story not one that ignores our mistakes or accommodates our past failures and not one that just glorifies our history or or that puts forth this so-called great man history of our country we can tell a story about who we have been
without the crutch of allusions or covering over the pain or the wretchedness and instead tell a story of the greatness of a country and who we can be together who we have been in overcoming this because America has shown greatness not because of the absence of violent bigotry and white supremacy but because of our efforts together to overcome it in truth ours is the story of the faith we have had in one another how we have
formed through courage and love multiracial multi-religious multi-ethnic coalition's to affirm our most sacred of civic virtues to affirm that common cause and to fight for that common singular destiny that is the American destiny ours is the story of abolitionists black and white who together organized for freedom knowing in the words of our beloved Toni Morrison that the function of freedom is to free somebody else a story of the
women who organized for the right to vote multi racial coalition's and the men who stood worked and allied with them ours is the story of workers immigrants and native born who joined together to organize an end child labor and create the 40-hour workweek ours is the story of civil rights activist a rainbow coalition of Americans from every race and every religion joining together who marched and sat in and stood up against segregation and
equality for all people who invested themselves in the idea and understanding that we need each other this is the story of our nation that we must tell not the absence of racism and bigotry and anti-semitism but the power of what happens when we come together across the lines that divide us to affirm the ties that bind us and work to create a more Beloved Community in our nation this is the story of this sanctuary this Church of faith and fellowship of the Bible
verse that speaks to our Civic gospel that is said here in churches like this all across the country that whenever two or three are gathered together he is in the midst that's the ideals we hail e pluribus unum one nation under God indivisible from the very beginning the story of this church has been a story about the power of that kind of faith in God and in one another when this sanctuary was burned down by white supremacists the
community rebuilt here on this hallowed soil with faith in God and in one another when black churches were outlaws this community this church met in secret for decades with faith in God and in one another and when evil showed itself in this church basement four years ago this church again showed that the faith he showed what faith in actions look like and when nine souls were taken Reverend clementa pinckney Reverend Shonda Coleman singleton Cynthia Hurd Susie
Jackson at the Lance the Reverend to pain middleton-doctor Towanda Sanders reverend daniel simmons senior and Myra Thompson this community this church showed us how not to allow hate when it comes into our lives to take root in our souls Polly Sheppard felicia saunders Jennifer Pinckney and all of the family and loved ones of those who were taken you showed us the freedom the Liberty that comes with grace and in forgiveness and you granted
the entire community the freedom showed the whole country the liberty and the redemption that comes through love that is who we are that is the American story that is the common aspiration that we must cling to in times of wretchedness and pain and agony and hurt it's with faith in God in one another and in who we can be that we come here together today not because of hate but because of love and I cannot separate the office I seek from Who I am
but this is not a political moment I'm not here today to ask for a vote I'm here today to ask if we again as a nation have the collective resolve to change the reality we live in I'm here today to ask if we have it in ourselves to tell a renewed new story an honest story about our nation because we know the truth will set us free we know that these are not problems that will just go away inevitably this is a hard and painful and difficult work it will take
sacrifice and struggle but that's the nature of love we are here today because of our ancestors showing this kind of sacrifice this kind of love because of those who join together across lines of separation to join in pursuit of our common national aspiration they did what was difficult because they had faith in God in each other and in a bolder broader more inclusive patriotism for patriotism is love of country but you can't love your country unless you love
your fellow country man and woman all of them and when you seek to lead in your community in your church in your city and your country in your nation you got to know you can't leave the people if you don't love the people all the people we now must have the courage to turn to each other to join together we must reaffirm our common bonds in the face of those who every day seek to rip us asunder
we must actively affirm or love in the face of this rising hate of our day we must now dedicate ourselves as our ancestors did to being freedom fighters for liberty is one of the most sacred of all of our civic values we must be freedom fighters we must dedicate ourselves to freedom again now we in this generation that freedom fight that is our national tests those who peddle hate at home and abroad those who seek to pit us against each other we must be
freedom fighters we must know now struggle to put more indivisible back into our one nation under God we must be freedom fighters we now must label to do the difficult labor to do the difficult we must be freedom fighters we must stand together and walk together and struggle together for a new American freedom in our generation freedom from fear freedom from violence freedom from hatred freedom to seek freedom to prosper freedom to dream America anew
again once and for all let us be the land of the free there is only one way to get there and that's together only one way to win with the power the healing and the salvation we find in love let us proclaim that we can be a nation in our generator to sing the songs of our answers to proclaim that we are going to be the generation that truly will be free at last thank you for having me here god bless you and God bless america

thank you I have to start by just giving thank you thank you all right I want to start off did my mom do a great job I want to thank my mother it was her example all my life for example of grace and courage and service it's her love which is a reason why I'm here today I wish my dad could be here and in my heart I believe he is here as you said we're here today to seek justice we're here today because we are impatient for that justice and our
sense of moral urgency our impatience comes from the most demanding of all values it comes from love love of our families love of our communities love of our country and love of each other you know the mayor was right Newark brick city this community this community taught me all about that love it's not that feel-good easygoing love it is strong courageous love it is defiant love the kind of love that works
through heartbreak and pain and betrayal it's the kind of love that keeps on going and never gives up it's the kind of love that sacrifices the kind of love that is essential to achieving justice I learned right here on these streets that you can't make progress by dividing people it can't make progress by stoking fear or setting us one against the other I learned that the only way to overcome
the really tough challenges is by extending grace finding common ground and working together and we know this that today so many of us are hurting so many of us are understandably angry so many of us are feeling afraid for our futures and our families too many people believe the force is tearing us apart are stronger than the bonds that hold us together well I don't believe that I believe we will bring our country together I believe
we will achieve things that other people say are impossible I believe we will make justice real for all people and that is why I am running for president of the United States of America and let me tell you let me tell you and let me tell you we are a great nation because of all our people into the people across the country who don't speak English as their
first language I want to say to many of you many of you yo voy a hacer una Presidente para todo nuestra gente innuendo payees I will be a president for all people in America when I arrived here in Newark over 20 years ago to work as a tenant rights lawyer I found a city with challenges that some folk said were intractable but we in Newark refused to believe that any problem is too hard to solve if we
tackle it together we were a community impatient for justice Newark has always been a community impatient for justice a community that knew in the words of dr. King wait has almost always meant never and the communities like ours and frankly in communities all across this country wait still too frequently means never wait for clean water wait for decent paying jobs wait for better schools wait your turn wait well here in Newark we refuse to wait when this
incredible City took a chance on me as their mayor the chief executive of this city New Jersey's largest city I didn't wait to start bringing people together we didn't just talk about the injustice of families not having heat in the coldest months of the year we took on the slumlord and doubled the rate of affordable housing production right here we didn't just talk about the injustice we didn't just wait to talk about the injustice of people not being able to
buy fresh fruits and vegetables we open grocery stores in food deserts we got people to invest here we open new businesses here we created thousands of jobs here together and after 60 years of decline after 60 years of the cly look around you newark is growing again and New Jersey when you sent me to Washington as your senator I brought those lessons with me politics in DC are
broken but we still found ways to bring people together and get things done after decades of criminal justice system moving in the wrong direction I led a bipartisan effort to write and pass the first meaningful reform in a generation and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to write and then pass a law that is bringing billions of dollars of investment to low-income urban and rural communities that have for too long been left out and left behind there are so
many places like that across America not just cities like this one farm communities and factory towns that like us here in Newark have been given up on and talked down to counted out and underestimated and they can't wait for change none of us can we are here today to say we can't wait
we can't wait when powerful forces are turning their prejudice into policy and rolling back the rights that generations of American fought for and heroes died for we can't wait when this administration is drawing children feel fleeing violence into cages banning Muslims from entering the nation founded on religious liberty and preventing brave transgender Americans from serving the country they love and we can't wait because many of our most
serious challenges as a nation were with us long before Donald Trump entered the White House we can't wait because we have a criminal justice system that in the words of my friend Brian Stevenson treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent a system a system so deeply baked with bias that it ruthlessly discriminates against black people and brown people and low-income people with mental illnesses folks with addiction we can't
wait when we have an economy where people who work two or three jobs pick up extra shifts where they can and they still can't pay the bills profits are soaring while wages for most Americans have barely budged massive corporations have taken over entire industries killing off competition driving out innovation squeezing out small businesses and American family farmers our first entrepreneurs are disappearing at a disturbing rate we have had decades
of unjust policies that have destroyed our economy and extracted money from our Commonwealth and plowed it into tax cuts for the wealthy and Wars overseas we didn't have to fight instead of investing in the things we all know grow our economy and create more opportunity for all like at education and infrastructure and that's why when I am President of
the United States we won't wait we won't wait for Criminal Justice before we will end the system of mass incarceration in America we will invest in people their education their mental health treating addiction we will end the school to Prison Pipeline and we will empower the formerly incarcerated with jobs and opportunity not a slippery slope back to jail and prison and we won't wait to legalize marijuana at the federal level but that is not enough we
will push states to do the same invest in the communities that have been devastated by the decades-long failed war on drugs and we will expunge the records of those who have already been convicted we won't wait we won't wait for more thoughts and prayers for communities that have been shattered by gun violence from Pittsburgh to parkland to Charleston to communities where kids fear the fireworks a 4th of July because
to them they sound like gunshots we will pass universal background checks we will ban assault weapons and close the loopholes that allow people who should never have a gun to get one and folks we will bring a fight to the NRA like they have never ever seen before and we will win we won't wait to meet the challenge and the crisis of climate change because we have no other choice we will build a clean energy economy we will hold polluters accountable and
ensure that every child can drink the water from their sink and breathe the air in their neighborhood without getting sick we won't wait for inclusive criminal excuse me for inclusive economic justice we will fight against the onslaught of attacks on workers rights in America you see it was my grandfather's Union job that helped my mom and my family move from poverty into the middle class and we will protect that pathway for workers who are now
seeing their rights eroded we will build and an opportunity economy where there are good paying jobs and fair wages in every neighborhood and where the dignity of work is respected where benefits are secured and portable so you can change jobs or start a new business with confidence and where small businesses can be as they always have been the main engines of job growth and economic growth in America and and we will change we will close we
will close the racial wealth gap in America because we can't be blind to the impact of generations of racism and white supremacy that were written into our laws over centuries that's why we will create a federally funded savings account for every child born in America that starts at birth and as they grow up it'll give the lowest income kids in our country up to $50,000 to pay for college put a down payment on a home or jump start a small business we won't wait to
deliver a great education to every child we will fully fund public schools and that especially includes special needs education and we will ensure that the most valuable profession in any democracy we will make sure that public schoolteachers get the pay increases they deserve the resources they need and their student loan debt is forgiven we won't wait to expand pathways to opportunity for all young people we will
make college affordable we will invest in and strengthen our HBCUs and and we will create the world's greatest system of apprenticeship and training programs right here in America we won't wait to fix our broken health care system because in America health care is a right I will fight for Medicare for all and I will start with lowering the age of Medicare eligibility and giving Americans a real public
option I will use the government government's bargaining power to once and for all bring down the cost of prescription drugs and I will once and for all end the sabotage of the Affordable Care Act we won't wait to fix our broken immigration system because in America immigration is and always has been a source of strength we will pass comprehensive immigration reform we will create a pathway to
citizenship for all those living in the United States and we will protect our dreamers and make them what they already are citizens of the United States of America we will end the moral vandalism of family separation and have an immigration system that affirms our values we won't wait to stop the dangerous assault on women's rights women will have reproductive justice we
are Americans women must have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and economic futures as your president I will aport appoint Supreme Court justices who will defend roe v wade and we will take on the systemic challenges that disproportionately affect women and hold back our entire country we will fight for equal pay affordable child care and finally establish a national paid family and medical leave program for our country
and we will build in our country starting with the highest office in the land and all across our nation we will build a culture where men respect women where sexual assault and harassment are no longer swept under the rug and future generations don't have to raise their hand to say me too we won't wait any longer for equal justice under the law we will pass the Equality Act and ensure that LGBTQ Americans are protected under federal civil rights law we will pursue
a new Voting Rights Act and gerrymandering and get the dark money out of politics once and for all and unlike this president I won't ignore or give license to white supremacy I will put more resources towards protecting our country from it and we will no longer wait for America to stand up for justice around the world we will strengthen our alliances and defend
human rights not coddle dictators or squander America's moral authority as commander in chief as commander in chief there is nothing I will take more seriously than the responsibility to protect our nation and and keep faith with the people who wear our uniform we call ourselves call ourselves the home of the brave but when our brave veterans come home we need to make sure that they have a home we will end
veterans homelessness veterans deserve everything they fought so bravely for health care education and good-paying jobs the only way we build a nation of liberty and justice for all is by doing it together we have to decide whether we will choose division and blame or if we will do the hard work of conquering fear with faith apathy with action and hatred
with love but we know the challenges we know that there are forces at work at home and abroad trying to get us to fight the wrong way and on their terms from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the Kremlin we know what their strategy is it's to pit us against each other for their own gain to make us suspicious of one another to make us fear each other
dislike each other to make us hate each other that's how they win now critics are going to tell you until all of us that a campaign powered by grace and love and a deep faith in each other can't beat that but I say it's the only way we win you see the president wants a race to the gutter and to fight us in the gutter but to win to win we have to fight from higher ground in order to bring this country to higher ground
so we can't allow them to divide us and we must also resist the urge to divide ourselves because the people on my block the people gathered here and folks all across the country can't wait they can't afford a politics of division that sacrifices progress for purity they can't afford to allow this election to become just an exercise and political posturing or box checking competition that is completely divorced from the realities of so many people who are
struggling and hurting look I'm the only senator who comes home to a low-income inner-city beautiful community and and I know and you know that we don't have the privilege to wait for what fits into someone else's narrow view of what it means to be a progressive our first priority must be to make people's lives better right now to move the ball forward how best we can as fast as we can and to ensure that the closest that those folks
that are closest to the pain and closest to the struggle have an active hand in defining how we confronted a real progressive movement refuses to stall out in righteous indignation it channels that indignation into the work that actually improves people's lives a real progressive movement does not hold progress for communities like mine hostage today for promises that perfection will come tomorrow we are the inheritors of those kind of movements
movements of committed Americans who came together gathering just like we are now this has been the truth of generations of people in our country who in moments of great moral crisis and great moral challenge summoned great moral imagination they did not surrender to the seduction of hatred they fought with a defiant love and when they rose our nation rose with them I'm here today we are here today because of those kinds of movements as many of you know I
wasn't born here in Newark when I was a baby my mom who you saw with my dad they tried to move into her neighborhood in Harrington Park New Jersey about 20 miles up the road from here they moved there attracted by the public schools its proximity to New York but real estate agents they refused to sell us a home because of the color of our skin and what would have been that us denied housing didn't happen because of a group of activists that came together a young
black activist who's the head of the Fair Housing Council and a group of white volunteers and who had watched and been inspired by the courage of civil rights marchers they worked to help black families in their community come together and they stood up against the illegal housing discrimination that my parents faced and they won and they changed the course of my entire life and so when you grow up with a mom like mine they made sure that
my brother and I never forgot what it took to get us to where we are they said like all of us in this generation that we could never pay back what has been done for us but we could and we had to pay it forward what my parents wanted us to do was to understand the urgency of the work still left to do in our country they wanted us to understand that in the face of injustice there is no wait there must be work there is no wait there must be struggle there is no wait
because all of us stand on the shoulders of giants generations before who did not wait and so here we are 56 years ago this very morning a young preacher woke up in a jail cell in Alabama because he and so many other young people had joined together to take on the toughest challenges of their day a fight others called impossible to win they join with local activists and eventually folks
from all around the country to confront a city where injustice and division were literally written into the law he was arrested on Good Friday morning while demonstrating against segregation and on this very date this very date Saturday April 13th in 1963 Martin Luther King woke up in that jail cell in Birmingham that same jail cell where he wrote on the margins of a newspaper that had been smuggled into him he wrote this letter these words for years now I have heard
the word wait this wait has almost always meant never we come to see that justice too long delayed is justice denied Martin Luther King on this date in history he spoke to the possibility of what we can achieve when we realize our own power and when we refused to wait the children of Birmingham and a man named King joining arms with others showed what was possible when they refused to wait and confronted dogs and fire hoses when they confronted and
defeated Bull Connor and brought down segregation in their City America America we know our history it is a perpetual testimony to impatient demanding unrelenting people in every generation with love stood up for justice generations of Americans have shown us what was possible when they refused to wait and now it is our turn and we have work to do America we can't wait America we will not wait
together we will run at the tough challenges together we will do the things that other people say are impossible together we will fulfill our pledge to be a nation of liberty and justice for all together we will win and together America we will rise
