[Applause] hello everyone [Applause] welcome America to boom I learn where are we [Music] now we don't let a little snow stop us we don't let a little cold stop us like are you guys even called tell the truth now when I said that elected leaders should go not just where it's comfortable but also where it's 
uncomfortable this is what I meant now John and I when I first think are amazing an incredible team and staff for putting this together also the city of Minneapolis parks thank you all the incredible people that turned out my friends Tina Smith and governor walls Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan highest-ranking Native American state official in our nation our congressional delegation thank you mayors commissioners legislators oh I forgot my 
dad who's 90 years old and you always want to thank your in-laws Bill and Marilyn from Mankato Thank You Dudley dee who traveled with Prince for so many years for being here hey if Prince could do that halftime show and all that rain I can do this in this snow sound the blackness Thank You rabbi Zimmerman Thank You friends from across the country this is why we live here Thank You Greater Minnesota thank you our suburbs and thank you the Twin 
Cities of Minneapolis st. Paul we are gathered here today on this beautiful Mississippi River America's great river running straight through the middle of our country through the heartland it takes its name from the Native American word for the father of waters it's starts small up north and like so many of you as a kid I got the thrill of going up there and claiming that I jumped clear over the Mississippi River it then gets wider as it was down here 
to the Twin Cities and then to Wisconsin where my mom was born and then down to Iowa [Music] a place where we in Minnesota like to go south for the winter or at least I do and then to Illinois a state that boasts a lot of extraordinary presidents from Abraham Lincoln to Barack Obama then that river meanders down to st. Louis well you'll find a big arch a gateway that honors our country's pioneers 
onwards to Kentucky and Memphis Tennessee where dr. Martin Luther King jr. went one April day to join sanitation workers fighting for dignity where he preached about the mountaintop and how he'd seen the promised land and then to Arkansas and Mississippi all the way down to New Orleans where the spirit of resilience abounds the Mississippi River all our rivers they connect us to one another to our shared story for this is how our country was founded with 
Patriots who saw more that United them than divided them and this is how this city the mill city and our country prospered right along this river and our nation's railways and roads grounded in the common belief that prosperity shared leads to better lives for all and this is how we became the world's beacon of democracy one in which every one matters we start in this place we're about a mile down river on a beautiful summer 
day a big bridge collapsed into this river I said on that day that a bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle of America not one of the busiest bridges in our state not a bridge just a few blocks from our home where John and Abigail and I drove over nearly every day but it happened and suddenly the eyes of the nation were on our state that day America saw in a very visceral way that everyone matters everyone they saw it in that off-duty firefighter who 
dove into the murky water over and over again looking through those cars and trucks submerged for survivors they saw it in the story of Paul texted the semi-truck driver who sacrificed his own life by veering off the road to save a school bus full of kids they saw it in the school staff member journey Hernandez who rescued each and every kid on that miracle school bus as it hung precariously next to a guardrail after plummeting 30 feet later we worked 
across the aisle to get the federal funding and we rebuilt that i-35w bridge in just over a year that that's community that's a shared story that's ordinary people doing extraordinary things but my friends that sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics we are tired of the shutdowns in the showdowns of the gridlock and the grandstanding today on this know a day 
on this island we say enough is enough [Applause] [Music] our nation must be governed not from chaos but from opportunity not by wallowing over what's wrong but by marching inexorably toward what's right and it has to start with all of us my family story is like so many of yours on both my mom and my dad side they arrived in this country with nothing but a suitcase but they made a home here it 
was cold okay maybe not as cold as this they didn't know anyone but like so many immigrants they wanted a better life for their families my grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines up north on the Iron Range he never graduated from high school he saved money and a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to college my dad who's here at age 90 got a two-year degree from Vermillion junior college 
and then finished up at the great University of Minnesota he became he became a journalist as a young thank-you person cheering as a young Associated Press reporter he called the 1960 presidential race for John F Kennedy he covered the 1968 conventions he interviewed everyone from Mike Ditka to Hubert Humphrey to Ronald Reagan to Ginger Rogers freedom of the press wasn't some abstract idea to my dad he embraced it he lived it my mom a proud 
union member taught taught second grade in the suburbs until she was 70 years old her students now grown still come up to me on the street and tell me she was their favorite teacher so today on an island in the middle of the mighty Mississippi in our nation's heartland at a time when we must heal the heart of our democracy and renew our commitment to the common good I stand before you as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner as the daughter of a 
teacher and a newspaper man as the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota to announce my candidacy for president of the United States [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I am running for this job for every person who wants their work recognized and rewarded I'm running for every 
parent who wants a better world for their kids I'm running for every student who wants a good education for every senior who wants affordable prescription drugs for every worker farmer dreamer and builder I am running for every American I'm running for you and I promise you this as your president I will look you in the eye I will tell you what I think I will focus on getting things done that's what I've done my whole life and no matter what I'll lead 
from the heart [Applause] okay let me be blunt for too long leaders in Washington have sat on the sidelines while others try to figure out what to do about the changing economy and its impact on our lives what to do about the disruptive nature of new technologies income inequality the political and geographic divides the changing climate the tumult in our world for a moment let's stop seeing those 
obstacles as obstacles on our path did we view the snow as an obstacle no we did not let's see those obstacles as our path this is what I mean there are insidious forces every day that are trying to make it harder for people to vote trying to drown out our voices with big money it is time to organize time to galvanize time to take back our democracy it's time America time to pass a constitutional amendment 
to overturn citizens united and get the dark money out of our politics it is time to stop discriminatory actions by restoring the Voting Rights Act it is time to pass my bill to automatically register every young person to vote when they turn 18 you see the obstacles that they're throwing at us with big money and limits on voting their obstacles but they're also our path they are how as Paul Wellstone would tell us they are how we 
organize here is another one climate change the people the people are on our side when it comes to climate change why because like you and I they believe in science that's why in the first 100 days of my administration I will reinstate the clean power rules and the gas mileage standards and put forth sweeping legislation to invest in green jobs and infrastructure and on day one we will rejoin the international climate agreement the obstacles they are our 
path here's another challenge way too many politicians have their heads stuck in the sand when it comes to the digital revolution hey guys it's not just coming it's here and if you don't know the difference between a hack and slack it's time to pull off the digital highway what would I do what would I do as president we need to put some digital rules of the road into law when it comes to people's privacy for too long the big tech companies have been telling you 
don't worry we've got your back while your identities in fact are being stolen and your data is being mined our laws need to be as sophisticated as the people who are breaking them we must revamp our nation's cybersecurity and guarantee net neutrality for all and we need to end the digital divide by pledging to connect every household to the internet by 2022 and that means you rural America I mean come on if they can 
do it in Iceland we can do it here we need to train our workers today for the jobs of tomorrow and strengthen our economy by planning ahead that means respecting and recognizing educational certifications and two-year degrees and making it easier for people to get them and yes and yes that means comprehensive immigration reform it is time America and by the way we should close those tax loopholes designed by and for the wealthy and bring down our debt and make 
it easier for workers to afford childcare housing and education that is what I mean by shared prosperity but we can't get there if people can't afford their health care and that means getting to universal health care and bringing down bringing down the cost of prescription drugs last week my guest to the State of the Union who is here with us today was Nicole Smith Holt Nicole's son Alec a 26 year-old restaurant manager from the southern suburbs aged 
off his parents health insurance three days short of his pay day Alec a diabetic wasn't able to afford his insulin he tried rationing it to save money it didn't work and he died this disgrace should never happen in the United States of America not with a simple drug that's been around for nearly a century the obstacle to change the big pharma companies think they own Washington well they don't own me and they don't 
own a call.we we are teaming up to pass meaningful legislation to bring in competitive safe drugs from other countries to stop Big Pharma's practice of paying off generic companies to keep their products off the market we're going to harness a negotiating power of 43 million seniors that's a lot of negotiating power and lift the ban on negotiating cheaper prices under Medicare for prescription drugs I have 
always believed in doing my job without fear or favor that's what I do as a senator and that's what I did as a prosecutor and that means not only convicting the guilty but protecting the innocent that's why I have and why I will always continue to advocate for criminal justice reform that's why in a state where we all value hunting and fishing and the great outdoors I am not afraid to join the vast majority of Americans including 
many gun owners to stand up to the gun lobby and put universal background checks and and common-sense gun legislation into law it is time America and a safer world isn't just about what we do here at home even if you want to isolate yourself from the rest of the world the rest of the world won't let you international problems come banging at your door just as opportunities come knocking we need to stand strong and consistently 
with our allies we need to be clear in our purpose we must respect our frontline troops diplomats and intelligence officers who are there every day risking their lives for us they deserve better than foreign policy by tweet and one last obstacle that we must overcome to move forward together stop the fear-mongering and stop the hate we may come from different places we may pray in different ways we may look 
different and love different but we all live in the same country of shared dreams in Minnesota we have the biggest Somali population in the country and we are proud of that community a few years ago at the height of the angry rhetoric a Somali American family of four went out to dinner right here in Minnesota this guy walked by he looked down at them and said you four go home you go home to where you came from and the little girl looked up at her mom and she 
said mom I don't want to go home you said we could eat out for dinner tonight I don't want to eat dinner at home you think of the innocent words of that little girl she only knows one home and that's our state she only knows one home and that's the United States of America Walt Whitman the great American poet once wrote these words I hear America singing the varied carols I hear for Whitman those were the songs of the mechanics the carpenters the Masons the 
shoemakers and those carols are still being sung today they are now also the songs of our sisters and brothers a chorus of different faiths races creeds and ways of life e pluribus unum out of one out of many at one it is more than a motto America it is the North Star of our democracy it is the North Star of our effort I am asking you to join this campaign it is a homegrown one I don't know if you can even see our number 
because of the snow but you can text Amy at nine one nine nine zero I don't have a political machine I don't come from money but what I do have is this I have grit I have family I have friends I have neighbors and I have all of you who are willing to come out in the middle of winter all of you who took the time to watch us today from home all of you who are willing to stand up and say people matter I'm asking you not to look down 
and not to look away anymore I'm asking you to look up to look at each other to look at the future before us let us rise to the occasion and meet the challenges of our day let us cross the river of our divides and walk across our sturdy bridge to higher ground one as one faith leader reminded me this week to pursue the good we must believe that good will prevail I do believe it and so do you so let's join together as one nation indivisible under God and 
pursue the good thank you and god bless america [Applause] forget the bull in the time 
[Applause] hey everyone I wore my Planned Parenthood pink but I could have worn purple for sciu also the color of Minnesota's prints right it is so wonderful to be here with all of you they say that the arc of the moral universe is long well you are the welders that are shortening it every day so thank you for that so you probably saw that I announced my candidacy for presidency in the middle of a blizzard 
right like a foot of snow coming on my head and after I did that the president took me on on climate change in one of his tweets and he actually called me snow woman and you know what I said to him I wrote back I'd like to see how your hair would fare in a blizzard mr. umbrella man so I chose that place to announce my candidacy on that Mississippi River because I want to make the point that it is time for us to cross the river of our divides to take 
something that you take care of every day a sturdy bridge of our democracy to a higher plane in our politics and we have someone in the White House right now that's trying to fracture our sense of community every single day he somehow thinks that organized hate is more powerful than unorganized love whoa maybe he's right but how do we respond to that we organize right we organize and that is how we win so here is my background it's actually kind of an 
organizing background so my grandpa has was mentioned work 1,500 feet underground in the mines up in Ely Minnesota the iron ore mines his whole life he never got to graduate from high school he helped raise his younger brothers and sisters he married my grandma had two boys one was my dad and my grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to a your Community College from there my dad got his journalism degree at the 
University of Minnesota and went on to get to go all over the world because of that degree my mom grew up in Milwaukee the site of our convention in 2020 and she got a teacher's degree and she moved to Minnesota why because they had strong teachers unions and she ended up teaching second grade until she was 70 years old and I still have people come up to me and tell me that she was her favorite teacher so I stand before you today as the granddaughter of an iron 
ore miner as the daughter of a teacher and a newspaper man as the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota and as a candidate for president of the United States that is what shared dreams in this country are all about no matter where you come from no matter who you know no matter what you look like and no matter who you love you can get ahead in this country and that's why I'm running for president so 
what I have seen in this White House to me is a tear down every day of our democracy and I know one of the things that unites all of you is this work to make sure that we have a strong democracy when you look at what's been going on this is what I think we need to do number one restore the Voting Rights Act right and make sure people develop number two pass my bill to register every eligible voter when they turn 18 okay that would like fix all this stuff 
and number three stand up for civil liberties right we've got a president in the White House that literally tweets whatever he wants every single day but doesn't respect the Amendment allow that allows him to do it we don't just tolerate the First Amendment we embrace it stand up for an independent judiciary and stop these judges that are trying to take us back to 1972 when women didn't have a right to choose what to do with their bodies 
that means funding Planned Parenthood and that means standing up against someone I mean this guy thinks a doctor shouldn't be making your decisions and working with you he thinks he should we stand up against that we also stand up against racial inequality and for civil liberties in this country and that means not just the first step back but the second step back and finally immigration reform I am so tired of hearing him talk about immigration the way he does 
because to me immigrants don't diminish America they are America so one of the things that we have seen this president do is he tries to talk the game right but instead what do we see is more and more dark money coming into our politics and I'm someone that thoroughly believes we need to judge people on the merit we need to allow people to run no matter their from actually in my life when I first ran for Senate no one could pronounce my name and I ended up giving 
up calling people all over the country cuz no one would call me back and I finally ended up just calling everyone I knew in my life and I raised what is still an all-time Senate record I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends I did that and as my husband has pointed out it is not an expanding base so if we want a real democracy we need to pass aggressive campaign finance reform and get the dark money out of these politics all right and guess what we can do two 
things at once we can maintain our democracy and have an optimistic economic agenda for this country that means supporting unions and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour right that means making sure that we take on and get to universal health care and take on those big pharma companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs I want you to remember that we can do this I'm someone that has gotten everywhere I got when I was running against someone who 
actually had a lot money than me and a lot more connections than me and they did it because I've got grit and I know you have that too you look at what you have done since that president got sworn into office the next day millions of people marched all over this world right we march peacefully and we march the next day 6,000 women signed up for office and now we're up to 30,000 on day 10 on day 10 after that mean-spirited a Muslim band that in that 
horrible refugee order got issued by the White House what happened people spontaneously showed up at the airports all around the country and protested who does that on a Saturday night you did it and they did it you did it on day 100 my favorite March the March for science my favorite sign what do we want science when do we want it after peer-review okay we march for science and we march to do something about climate change and it's your president I'll get us back 
into that international climate change agreement on day one you go through the summer when we stood up against that mean-spirited repeal of the Affordable Care Act every single Democrat stood together in the United States Senate and said no you're not going to kick off little toddlers with Down syndrome off of their parents insurance for a pre-existing condition we took them on and we won you go through the fall in that incredible incredible victory 
against racism and for decency and for dignity doug jones won that race in the state of alabama that happened or my favorite legislative races that fall in virginia new jersey where a woman actually won and she beat a guy who had the day of the woman's march had said i hope they'll be home in time to make dinner he got beaten by a woman then you go forward into the rest of the year where you saw those students march in unity those Parkland students joined by 
kids all across the country that said no not going to take this anymore the moms tried after Sandy Hook law enforcement tried everyone's tried and guess what guys after those kids March they didn't just March they voted and we get bested by a bunch of seventeen year olds to get common-sense gun legislation in place that's a right thing to do that's what's happened in this country and then you go to 2018 we're all of you stood and we work together I was leading our ticket 
in Minnesota in a state Donald Trump almost won well you know what we did I went to every single County I went to every single congressional district I led that ticket of to Senate seats a governor's seat and guess what I won for the third time in a row from rural to urban every single congressional district including Michele Bachmann's then you look at what we did we won the governor's race together in the state of Kansas and beat Crisco Bob we did that 
we won in Wisconsin and beat Scott Walker that anti-union activist we did that so you look at this March you look at the arc of the moral universe where we are headed as long as we stay together and we organize and we beat out that organized hate with organized people we will win in 2020 together thank you everyone [Applause] 
so much Wow I cannot think of a better group to be up here with and I am so excited to be here and excited about our bus that is great I remember once when I first had a bus on my first Senate race and it was this big kickoff at the University of Minnesota was not outside which you guys are so brave in the spirit of my snow field announcement but I remember it and I remember it was just it was an Al Gore was there and the center from North Dakota at the time 
byron Dorgan we had this band playing and then we got on the bus and we sat down and byron Dorgan turned to me and he goes you know what this is all really fun now it was a week before the election three months from now you're gonna be sitting inside your office reading a bill that you don't understand eating a tuna fish sandwich hey guys so remember this moment but this is just so exciting and I think you all know we're gonna be going on this twelve County 
tour across Iowa including Linn County Keokuk Washington Louisa Scott Dubuque Blackhawk Cerro Gordo Guthrie Warren Jasper and Tama County pretty exciting and we have of course covered over 50 so far we're calling this e all of America bus tour and that is because I don't just want to be the president for half of America I want to be the president for all of America and this is about we just came from New Hampshire where maybe you could cover 
every single County in 30 hours in a day and a half cuz they have ten of them in the middle of the Northeast er so don't feel cold until you've been out there but we did that and now we're here and as I said I can't think of three better people to be up here with me Mollie incredible representative was such a great spirit you can literally feel it when you see her my favorite memory of Mollie was the this the st. Patrick's Day parade in this town where 
I keep claiming she wore these green shamrock sweat pants and she keeps telling me they were jeans but anyway she she was you could just see the love from her constituents when you march in the parade as well as of course Rob very incredible an incredible incredible leader for this town in this community ahead of his time on issues of climate change then we have Liz a true public servant and yeah yeah but let's just talk about Liz for a second actually so 
now this is a true story because I know what you mean so she I was at her event in Robyn's right a few months ago and I've been this really really long day as many are and I had to somehow do hardball upstairs in this little room and I had like a minute and I sat down there and I could hardly give my speech but I listened to Liz's speech and it literally just cheered me up because as I listened to her I thought that this was the ultimate in goodness in a public 
servant she went through all the challenges she went through everything and then she went through every single thing she gotten done in such a caring way for the community I'm not kidding I thought well if Liz can do that I could do anything and so and I'm gonna read something about Liz written by someone knows her best her daughter listen to this yeah you didn't think this was gonna be about you but it is because this is important what I'm 
talking about here because I think so much of what Donald Trump has done has broken down our trust in our elected officials and that's what he wants to do every day and so for me one I want to win for a whole ticket right and flip the legislature in the state of Iowa because that is what I have done every single time when I lead the ticket in Minnesota but also because I think we have to remember what true public servants are about they're not putting 
their business interests in front of our country they're not putting partisan or political interests in front of our country great example right next to me over here so this is what is what that she said about Liz I've seen her skin grow thick through the years yep and I have no clue how she pushes herself to keep going she handles every punch thrown at her with grace and dignity she gives everything she has to this state I am so utterly proud of my mom and her 
choices because she's made them on her own terms that ring is your faith in politics and then there is Andy who believes in bringing people together not just politically but literally he's one as you know he's one of Iowa's best-known square-dance callers hey I did not know that until today and I got to meet with him and Connie in their home which was just beautiful and I could see how much they cared about not just their home and their family but 
Iowa and as you know Andy worked in the state legislature for 24 years as a Republican then he returned 15 years later after his kids were grown and he had retired from his law practice and according to him he found a very different Republican caucus when he returned and I think you've heard that he decided to switch parties and what you may not know is that it runs in his family his great-grandfather was a Democrat who became a Republican 
okay as he pointed out it was during the Civil War so it was like for a really good reason that's okay that's okay so but Indy did this and I think you know this made national news when Andy did this and he did this in in such a beautiful way and explaining his reasons he just didn't go oh I'm changing I'm mad he explained it and he did it at a time of deep political division he faced tremendous pressure from fellow Republicans but 
Andy is someone who stands up for what he believes he said then quote the time comes when you have to be true to yourself and follow the dictates of your conscience for me that time is now you know what I'm thinking that maybe I should read that quote in the chamber of the US Senate as we head into certain proceedings and certain decisions that are going to have to be made the time comes when you have to be true to yourself and follow the 
dictates of your conscience for me that time is now and II refused to stand by as Donald Trump took his country and really his party in the wrong direction and he said Americans of all parties should insist on something far better from the man holding the highest office in the land so that's what this is about today this is about people deciding that they want something better that they deserve something better in our country that we 
can do so much better than this and that's why for this olive America tour we are going to cities yes we are starting the tour and making you guys sit outside at 9:00 in the morning on a cold day because we have so much work to do we are gonna go to rural areas and small towns and we are reaching out to our fire Democratic base and you know they are fired up but we are also are also reaching out to independence and to moderate Republicans and we kind of have 
a secret sauce here to do that first of all our fired up Democrats I think you know we have been on a march together since day one since Donald Trump was inaugurated we've marched for the right things we've marched for women's rights we've wrought marched for immigrants rights we have marched thank you Renee yes that was that was a good point for very good reason we have stood up when this president has said things like after Charlottesville 
when he said there are two sides remember that we said no when the other side is a Ku Klux Klan there are not two sides there's only one side and that is the American side that is all of a mirror all of America also means the people that I met with when I went to those blue wall states right when I met with those carpenters in Pittsburgh when I met with the dock workers in Michigan when I met with the dairy farmers in 
Wisconsin when we recently in Dayton Ohio and I met with a survivor of that shooting where nine people were gunned down in 30 seconds or when we were in Toledo with students there or when we were right here in Iowa and as I told all of them what happened in 2016 and those were states Pennsylvania Michigan Wisconsin Iowa and Ohio those were states that Donald Trump won some of them he won big right and then what happened if you look at facts I'm by the 
way I believe in the truth and facts it's a very important part about me that you need to know that maybe you saw on that debate stage so when you look at the facts what happened in 2018 we came roaring back sherrod Brown won that Senate seat in Ohio with really no problem we won in Pennsylvania of the governor the senator we won in Michigan with a new woman governor by the way whose slogan was fix the damn roads very direct okay we want in Wisconsin and if 
you don't think we can win in the Midwest I have four words for you former Governor Scott Walker and he didn't win everything in Iowa but we flipped to house eats and city that happened and we're excited about Rita and we are really excited about JD winning in the state of Iowa so that's what happened we flipped those so when you look back at 2016 you realize we need to bring those people with us nearly ten percent of Donald Trump 
voters voted for Barack Obama that's a true fact so when I was out in those states I told them this we're gonna build a blue wall around those states and we're gonna make Donald Trump pay for it because I have talked to these voters the rancher in Minnesota who told me last summer that he had voted for Donald Trump because he was mad about a few things and he was in his house and he didn't look like someone was gonna start to cry a lot of these people when 
they tell me these stories they cry so it's just out when you win there's no cameras there by the way um and he started to cry and he talked about for him it was the boy scout rally when he heard Donald Trump politicized the Boy Scouts probably not a lot of people in the country remember that but he did because he was a boy scout and so as he's crying in his living room he says to me I still remember that moment and I went and I voted for him in the ballot 
box and he said that wasn't patriotic that was wrong and I'm not doing it again that's what Sam then we had the union worker in Pittsburgh who told me he voted for him because he thought Donald Trump was gonna build things baby's gonna build things his name was on the tower he newly done things and then every time when they see where is this new infrastructure in festival right have we seen it in Iowa have we seen new 
levees and the think the big federal investment that we want to come in no that has not happened said he realized he wasn't keeping his promise that it was a fake promise just like those gold letters on those time the soybean farmers right here who tell me you know well we thought he was gonna have our backs look what happened soybeans piling up in bins all over Iowa all over Minnesota all over states like Ohio because of his trade 
war that he won't get done and even though he said oh I've negotiated this and this and this what do we find out when he calls the president of China the reports are one of the things he does instead of talking only about the trade war and the house he finds tries once again to find dirt on a pool this is what this guy does or how about the waivers to the big oil companies we have seen plants closed ethanol and biodiesel plants right here in the state of Iowa 
because he decided to sell out the oil companies and now after the fact just like what Andy mentioned about Syria and the bloodshed there after the fact when he realizes he really screwed up and he tries to fix it he tries to fix it with sanctions after the fact he tries to fix it with throwing a bunch of money at her farmer when what you would really like to do is just farm that's what he's done or the guy that came up to me in line in Conway New Hampshire yesterday so I want 
you to picture this you've got a bunch of people you know the storm is raging outside and we've got our fired up base and they have stickers on that say like I'm a Supreme Court voter right I have a Planned Parenthood voter and they're all in line and we're doing selfies they did it oh and then this one guy comes up he has no sticker on any whispers so that no one else could hear him voted for Donald Trump and then he goes don't tell anyone 
anyway that is what's happening across America so I just want us to remember that I know that's not what this primary discussions are about but when we stand up there on that debate stage the candidates we've got an obligation an obligation to debate policies that's what debates are about right but we also have an obligation to make the case yes to our fired-up base for change in policy but also to independence and moderate Republicans 
that we want to bring with us because I don't just want to eat by a victory in this election I want to win big win big what does that mean that means you can get all the things done that we want to get done that we have to get done for a rural economy that's what that means to make sure that we have the hospitals in the education system something that I've rolled out here that we have mental health treatment for the people that need it that we do so 
much better than sixty-four public mental health beds for the state of Iowa which is where you are stuck right now that's what this is about this is about getting these things done and that is the difference between a plan and a pipe dream right we want to bring down the cost of pharmaceutical we have to it's the number one issue for people for healthcare and when you look at my record as Liz mentioned when you look at 
my record you see someone that has actually gotten things done that's taken on this problem I passed one of the few bills actually that we got done on prescription drugs and that was to get at prescription drugs shortages of things like kids cancer drugs but I lead the bell on unleashing the power of 43 million seniors so we can finally bring down the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare there is a ban on negotiating drug prices under Medicare 
are bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries like Canada right right now you can see it literally as I see we can see Canada from our porch a minute thank you I'm glad you guys like my jokes but that is what we're talking about here we're talking about these clear solutions and to do it you have to have a plan but you have to have deadlines and you have to be able to bring people with you in a big way to 
get things done so I think you know how high the stakes are you know that this is about changing policies yes but it is also about changing the tone in our politics that means we have to look up from our phones I'm so glad no one's on their phones right now I accept you guys fact that we have to look up from our phones and change the tone in our politics that is what this is about we have to look at each other because we know what these 
stakes are president that doesn't see the difference between an America as good as its promise and in America he can sell for a promise that's him and I am still waiting to find out how he thinks making that call to the president of Ukraine and getting him to try to interfere in our election by looking for dirt on a political opponent I'm still waiting to find out why that makes America great again right I'm still waiting to find out why leaving 
the Kurds for slaughter and allowing Russia to fill the void how that makes America great again and I am still waiting to find out when he is asked by a reporter at the g20 about invasion in our own elections by Russia he turns to flat amir putin on the world stage in front of everyone's watching and makes a joke about it that doesn't make America great again that makes Russia great again that's what he's doing and I'm telling you 
because I know some of this foreign policy stuff seems far and far away but it's not it's really what we stand for you think of those veterans thousands and thousands of through the years have lost standing up for our democracy and democracies around the world think about the greatest generation they stood up for what's right and for human rights and for democracy think about those four little girls who lost their life in that Church 
in Birmingham Alabama they just commemorated the anniversary of that they were innocent they were innocent because people were trying to take rights away forever since the founding of this country we have stood up for our democracy and for human rights and that's what we have to remember is at stake here that's what's happening right now so Iowa you have been always in the lead on this you led with the Granger movement 
that took on monopoly power and consolidation you did you led with Norfolk for one who with his Green Revolution [Music] no I actually I met him I also went I'm kidding I met I actually went to the unveiling of his statue in the statuary statutory Hall in Congress and it was amazing cuz I had always thought he was from Minnesota because while I knew that he had gone to college they were taught 
there it was taught at the University of Minnesota and then when I got there I realized that was the only one from Minnesota there and it was like Tom Harkin and the whole Iowa delegation they were all there and I realized he had one little Minnesota thing like a ring or something on the statue that's when I realized that truth okay let's start over with the dramatic moment okay you led with the Granger movement [Music] 
the world and save people from starvation you led with Edna Griffin who took on where I began in the middle of that River in the middle of that snowstorm with four inches of snow on my head and the reason I picked that place is that it was only a mile away before that 35w bridge collapse in the middle of a beautiful and as I said the next day a breach does just doesn't fall down in the middle of 
America and we rebuilt bigger story than that it's awesome save himself he peered off 30 kids he's incredible everyday that's what all of you do the citizens of this country and that's what I'm trying to do in this presidential race because I see a place of extraordinary power in Washington DC in that White House and I've seen through the years how great presidents 
how people like Barack Obama can rise no one thought he was gonna be able to win that race with the name like Barack Obama okay but he did it because he brought people with us and he did it for the right reason and people trusted him right now we have a deficit of trust in this country we have a deficit fiscally that this president make keeps making worse every day we have a deficit when it comes to our world's respect but we also have a deficit of trust from our 
citizens so I can promise you this Iowa I'm going to restore that trust and I'm going to be one of those ordinary people that does extraordinary things but I'm not going to be able to do it without you so let's get on this bus and let's make this case to the people and that is how we win 
Thank You Iowa Democrats I am your senator next door and I can see Iowa from my porch so neighbors you may have seen my announcement in the middle of a Minnesota blizzard you know what happened after that announcement the president sent out a tweet and he made fun of me for talking about climate change in the middle of a snowstorm and he gave me a nickname snow woman so I wrote back hey Donald 
Trump the science is on my side and I'd like to see how your hair would fare in a blizzard I announced by that River because I wanted to make the point that I come from the heartland and yes we have snow in the heartland and I don't come from money but I have grit you know I got into politics with that grit when our daughter was born and she was really sick she couldn't swallow and back then the insurance companies had a rule that they kicked you out of the hospital 
after 24 hours and she was in intensive care and I got kicked out of that hospital and when we got out and she got a little better I went to the legislature as a new mom not an elected official and advocated and got passed one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48-hour hospital stay my background it's a little different than Donald Trump my grandpa a union member worked 1,500 
feet underground in the mines he saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to Community College my mom she grew up in Wisconsin she became a teacher a proud union teacher and she taught second grade until she was 70 years old and I stand before you today as the granddaughter of an iron ore miner the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman the first woman elected to the United States Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for 
president of the United States that is what this country is about there no matter where you come no matter who you know no matter what you look like no matter what your connections are no matter who you love that you can become President of the United States that is a country of shared dreams and we have a president that tries to fracture those dreams every single day and I say what better place to vow to revive the heart of America than in the heartland of 
America what does this mean it means an optimistic economic agenda bridging that rural urban divide it means making sure that people in the urban areas understand that food just doesn't magically appear on your table it means investing in child care and fair housing infrastructure and getting our education system back on track Iowa it means standing up too risky schemes of privatizing Medicaid it means standing up for our rural Hospital and it means 
saying to those big pharma companies you know what you might have to lobbyists for every member of Congress you might think that they own Washington but they don't own me that is what standing up for America is about so let's stand up for our unions and the right to organize because when unions are strong our economy is strong let's stand up like the Rangers of Iowa 130 years ago and stand up against monopoly power and let's pass a 
constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United that is how we get the dark money out of our politics but to do this we need to win and I know I can win because I've done it every place everywhere every time and if we don't think we can win in the Midwest with a Midwestern er heading our ticket I have four words for you former Governor Scott Walker Iowa look at the arc that we are on the day after the inauguration millions of people peacefully marched 
across the country day nine the meze and spirited refugee order people spontaneously showed up at the airport day 100 the March for science my favorite sign what do we want science when do we want it after peer review then the fighting Democrats we stood up against their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then those students marched against gun violence and they didn't just March they voted and then finally last fall with Abby and 
Cindy and all of your help we turned the House of Representatives back into the people's house that is how we win that is how we win in 2020 and that is how we will bring back America and revive the heart of America that is what my campaign is about it is a grassroots effort 
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well hello good neighbors it is great to be back here at the wingding last time I had 20 minutes and this time I have 20 candidates ah and I get to go first and 
I got to tell you remind me my first time I was ever in the White House Bill Clinton was president I was a young prosecutor I had done a lot of work on hate crimes and he invited me to introduce him when he introduced that very important Matthew Shepard bill and as I stood outside I had never been in there before and I've got the President on one side outside the East Room I've got Jan arena on the other and the military band starts playing hail to the 
chief you know dude and I start walking in and all of a sudden I feel this big hand on my shoulder and this voice says I know you're gonna do great out there but when they play that song I usually go first well that was my first time there in the White House the Iowa Democrats but it won't be my last so I have spent the last few days on a 20 count eat or and after the tragedies of this weekend it reinvigorated me it reinvigorated me as I stood in front of 
that barn and with the flag and I thought to myself you know what this flag is flying over El Paso today and it is flying over Dayton today and that is because we are one America we are one America and there are not two sides no they're not when the other side is the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist there is only one side and that is the American side and I have had so many Iowans approached me about gun safety and about doing something about 
background checks an assault weapon ban and magazines it's been unbelievable and I told them all the story of when I sat across from the president after parkland advocated for gun safety nine times he said he wanted universal background checks and then the next day he goes and meets with the NRA and he folds as your I will not fold an economic agenda for this country should unite rural and urban and that is why I have been out there talking about yes the farm bill 
but also childcare we know the issues and also about housing and education and hospitals and making sure that we have enough mental health beds when there are only 64 in the state of Iowa that is not acceptable and I will end this practice of privatizing Medicaid this is wrong in the state of Iowa it all starts here this change because you Iowa you gave us a Grainger movement that took on those big monopolies right you gave us Norman Borlaug right Norman Borlaug who 
believed in science you gave us Edna Griffin who took need not take no for an answer when she wanted to be served in Des Moines at the height of the civil rights movement and yes you gave us ABI and Cindy and Rita and JD that are changing this country we have a guy in the White House now who is afraid he is afraid of the future right he's afraid of the NRA he's afraid of science he's afraid of equal whites we are not afraid of equal rights we are not afraid of the 
future we are not afraid of women having a seat at the table he is afraid he is afraid of a woman in the White House we are not afraid of that he is afraid of working people having the same rights and a chance to succeed as wealthy people we are not afraid we embrace that right that is what this is about he is looking back and he is afraid we are not and especially not in this state so I'm asking you to join me not with fear I'm asking you to join me to build 
a future free of fear for the future let's go and get it done Thank You Iowa [Applause]
