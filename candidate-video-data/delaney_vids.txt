[Music] the biggest problem with Trump is that he's not focused on the future and he's not doing the things we need to do structurally to make our economy more competitive to make our country more entrepreneurial and to position people to succeed in that new economy that we all know is coming Democrats can't win by just attacking the trunk we really have to show the American people there's a better way we have to think about the 
future America is going to win by recognizing what's going on across our economy and in people's lives and then focusing on what we can do collectively to make things better that's the American Way John Delaney is a force of nature he can tackle things no one else can tackle and he can make progress on issues that other people get daunted by John just simply doesn't have an equal and his ability to tackle hard things and make progress people listen to John 
and they say I can sign up for that plan so unbalanced global trade reshaped and improved our country in the world but it didn't help everyone and no one stood up to make sure entire communities were decimated and those hurt more helped the backbone of our country the people who built our nation and save the world were tragically ignored now there's another big wave of global change happening technological innovation and automation are reshaping 
the economy and jobs and the country we need to step up and do the right things inside the Republican solution is to divest healthcare training education that's a backwards approach it's actually time to do the real things we need to do to grow our economy and wages in every part of our country it's time for a new social contract it builds a cleaner safer stronger and more just society John grew up the son of a union electrician hard work decent pay health 
care a pension he understands what that means for a working family it was a union scholarship that helped John afford college and building two businesses from scratch John succeeded by working with others like his dad did on a job site he builds teams he's creative and into problem solver and he's always motivated by scent of progressive and ethical values we work with John back in 2004 the strategy was to grow ASG 
through the challenge for the larger banks to finance a company like ours John's firm was one of the few that stepped up and gave us the credit facility that made sense to us we went from 150 employees back in 2003 to over a thousand employees today and John Delaney helped peel back growth jobs the progressive businessman and building his companies keep always insisted on the highest of ethical standard he treated people with respect 
created jobs with good pay and benefits and always was giving back to the community the Obama administration awarded John's company the bank enterprise award for investing in communities that so many banks under serve and ignore that's classic John always doing more when I ran for Congress I said back then let's stand up for workers instead of big companies or big banks let's invest in our country and 
its people but Trump and the Republicans want to roll back laws to protect consumers and our economy that's a huge mistake but attacking banks won't win the day we need to lay out a new approach to economic growth income growth for the middle class and security in the workplace John Delaney has the skill and experience to resolve some of our country's biggest issues John wrote a bill that deals with our two trillion 
dollar repatriation issue and our ailing infrastructure which is estimated to be a trillion dollar investment we need to make all the one though it created tens of thousands of jobs it was nonpartisan and very smart on a number of levels and has a support of a lot of members being a progressive means thinking about the future through the lens of people who work who raise families who want their kids to get ahead technology and our global 
interconnections will make life better in so many ways but the disruption of jobs alone is a massive challenge and the political system isn't stepping up to deal with it this is bigger than politics in part we need new ideas on the future of work in the context of this rapid technological change and these immense challenges set to unfold for our workers in our economy and we need to bring our people our businesses and our government together to shape a 
future that is safe secure and prosperous the time of fighting amongst ourselves must end we need to work for the common good haven't we had enough destructive partisan wars where people put party over country I've been blessed raised in a blue-collar family where an honest day's work was honored and family was everything married for 27 years with amazing woman and the father of four wonderful daughters what guy can 
complain about that a successful businessman lucky enough to be elected to Congress in able to serve incredible constituents from an amazingly diverse and beautiful state giving me the chance to fight for the causes I believe in and this I know beyond everything this is not a nation where success is a birthright it's burned it's earned through hard work and it's made possible by a commitment to a shared destiny and then 
a set of policies that can and should make it possible we allow ourselves to be divided and we let our political debate curate into an us-versus-them we will fall fall short but if we take these challenges head-on the future is ours 
We all know that we're a nation of immigrants. Let me tell my own personal immigration story. It's about my grandfather.
His name was Al Rowe. He came to this country in 1923
with his seven brothers and sisters into Ellis Island When they arrived, young Al was detained. He wasn't let into this country. His seven brothers and sisters were let in but he was detained. And the reason he was detained was because he only had one arm. And back then, in 1923, we didn't let 
people with disabilities into our country. They sent him to Staten Island to be deported but his family got him an appeal. The appeal was held in the Great Hall of Ellis Island. Some of you have probably been there. He used to tell the story that he was just a little boy, he goes into this hall, there are hundreds of people, he's scared in the back of the room. And the judge walks in. And as the judge is putting on his robe, My grandfather saw that the judge, also, 
had only one arm. And that's the only reason he got let into this country. The one armed judge let in the one armed boy. A little bit of shared humanity which is what I think we need today. But that's a reminder that we are, in fact, all a nation of immigrants. And that's my own personal story. 
thank you thank you for that nice introduction it's really great to be with you here this weekend and you see so many great Democrats in one room ready to go ready to fight ready to win right all right so let's I stand before you as someone who has lived the American dream and I'm so grateful for the opportunities this is this amazing country has given me it gave me the opportunity to learn and get a great education and be the first of my family 
to go to college it gave me the opportunity to be an entrepreneur and a business builder and create thousands of jobs and get an award from the Obama administration for the work we did in disadvantaged communities right you gotta invest in communities I always used to say business unless someone invests nothing happens and we need more investments in so many communities around this country and I know how to do it the opportunity to serve my country 
in the Congress of the United States and fight for kids like myself who grew up in working families I need a shot need an opportunity and most importantly the opportunity to be blessed with an amazing family happily married for 29 years and four daughters that I'm so proud but my story is just getting so much harder these days young people today will be the first generation of Americans that don't actually do better 
than their parents think about that the first generation ever we're leaving the debts they can't repay fiscal bets climate bets we're leaving them a world where a half of the American people can't afford a five hundred dollar expense where 40% of hardworking Americans can't afford their basic necessities like their rent their food their utilities how did this happen well it's really simple the world changed really fast technology and globalization 
all the stuff we talked about all the stuff we read about has caused so many of our country to be left behind and we didn't do the basic things we should have done a long time ago to prepare that for this world and invest in them and invest in their communities and that was our failure a responsible nation would have created a universal health care system a long time ago absolutely that's what a responsible nation a responsible nation would have looked 
at the condition of hardworking Americans and said we're going to do tax policy that helps you and doubled the Earned Income Tax Credit and raise the minimum wage and created that paid family leave these are the kind of things to do if you put the worker at the center of your agenda a responsible nation would have built infrastructure trillions of dollars of infrastructure that there's so many of our communities need we would have done that a long time 
ago we reformed our immigration system on issue after issue we have left the American people down so I don't think what the American people need is more gridlock more partisanship or more ideology you know and I think they need they need solutions they need us to get real things done that matter in their lives which is why I believe in what I call the politics of progress sure we should have a battle of ideas sure we should debate the big issues of the day 
but what we also need to do is roll up our sleeves and get things done get things done that matter to hardworking Americans you know my dad was an electrician he worked with his hands every day we didn't have any complicated political discussions at the dinner table except for one thing that my bag told me a thousand times he said if you care about workers you vote for the Democrats that was our pudding 
and we gotta get back to that we got to be the party that puts forth common-sense solutions not impossible promises where we can actually get real things done that matter to the American people like do things to create jobs in every community do things to invest in infrastructure in every community do things that boost wages in every community create a universal healthcare system improve public education so that every kid no matter the condition of 
their birth it's the same educational opportunities as every young person in this country these are the kind of things that have to become the true north of this amazing party of ours and I'm running for president to be the person who can get those things done things that matter to the American people you know in 1958 John F Kennedy gave a speech when he was a senator and he said we should not seek the Republican answer 
we should not seek the Democratic answer we should seek the right answer he went on to say we should not seek to fix blame for all the problems of the past we could sit there all day and point fingers but what we should do is own a responsibility for our future as Americans that's where the Democratic Party has to be I don't want to just be your president to be your president I want to be your president to do the job to do the job and the job of the 
President of the United States in 2020 is to take this terribly divided nation where an American has been pitted against American and start bringing it back together and reminding us of this notion of common purpose which is worth fighting for every day of our lives and when we do that we can start getting real things done that matter we can start solving problems and we can fulfill our most sacred responsibilities which is to leave this world better than 
we have and we can do it but we have to do it together and it is the calling of the Democratic Party and the presidency of the United States thank you for having me [Applause] in 2020 [Applause] 
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage Maryland representative John Delaney so good evening wingding come on we can do better than that let me try something else good evening the good Democrats we're going to send JD Shelton to the Congress the United States that's more like it how's everyone doing this evening so in about six months you have an awesome responsibility when you go to caucus and I think you have to ask yourself two 
questions the first question is what candidate can beat Donald Trump because we got to send that reckless lawless dishonorable human being out of the White House as soon as possible but to do that we need a candidate that has an economic vision that excites every American whether you're in a city or in a rural community and I've been to all 99 counties so I know what their people are talking about you got to put forth a candidate who's got real solutions to 
the challenges we face as a nation not impossible promises you got to put forth a candidate who will build a big tent Democratic Party like we did in 2018 when we flipped the House of Representatives by putting forth candidates that progressives and moderates and independents and even disaffected Republicans can get excited about but the second question I think you have to ask yourself is who should lead our country because we need 
leadership badly at this moment in time we need to re-establish our leadership role around the world we need a leader who's committed to finding common ground and getting things done that matter to hardworking Americans at their kitchen table and you know what we need more than anything we need an individual who will restore decency and honor to the office of the presidency and I stand before you Iowa because I believe on the right answer to those two 
questions and that's why I'm running for president and maybe it's the journey I've had with my own life you know I've lived the American dream and I'm so grateful for the opportunities this extraordinary country has given me to learn and be the first in my family to go to college to build to businesses and create thousands of jobs to be blessed to be married to an amazing woman for 29 years and have four extraordinary daughters and then the opportunity to 
serve my country in the Congress of the United States but my story is getting harder to find you know young people today will be the first generation of Americans that won't do better than their parents and we're also leaving them debts that they will not be able to repay fiscal debts and climate debts so I don't believe what the American people need is more gridlock more partisanship or more rigid ideology I think you need solutions I think we need big ideas like 
my plan for universal health care but it preserves choice I think we need massive investments in our country in infrastructure and in basic research which was why I'm proposing the largest investment in infrastructure and research that we've had since the building of the national highway system and the creation of NASA I think we need real solutions to the big issues we face as a nation and not only is that the right way to govern it's the right way 
to win you know in 1958 John F Kennedy looked out at the American people and said we shouldn't seek the Republican answer we shouldn't seek the Democratic answer we should seek the right answer and he was right then and he's right today he is right today and this is the calling of the Democratic Party to become the party that the American people so desperately are looking for a party that conducts itself with honor and dignity 
and works for hardworking Americans and gets things done that matters in their life and leads us not only here but around the world by getting back in things like the trans-pacific partnership with President Obama was right every acre of land in Iowa would be worth more today if we were in that agreement that's how we beat Trump in Iowa but this has to be our way forward you know our fundamental fundamentally 
believe that our most important responsibility is to leave the world better than we found it and the one thing I want to tell you is this is not about me you know there's a great day in all of our lives when we realize it's not about us it's about what we can do for other people that's why I decided to dedicate the rest of my life to public service ten years ago to make a difference in the world so I'm not running for president just to be 
your president I'm running for president to do the job to lead to get things done and restore dignity and respect to the most sacred office in the United States of America the office of the presidency god bless you Iowa thank you for having me and have a great wing-dings thank you all thank you 
so I have been everywhere good afternoon Iowa how's everyone doing all right good so one of the great privileges of traveling to all 99 counties as I've seen so many familiar faces here this afternoon and it's been great to talk to you particularly in rural Iowa and don't let anyone tell you rural Iowa doesn't matter anymore because I think it does and talk about there you go and talk about how we build the big tent Democratic Party that we 
need to win and govern so I stand before you as someone who has lived the American dream and I'm so grateful for all the opportunities this country has given me to be the first in my family to go to college to be a successful entrepreneur to serve my country in the Congress the United States and most importantly to be blessed with an amazing family but these stories are so much harder for young people today why because we stopped doing our job we 
stopped doing the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for the future I stand before you here today as someone who does not believe that what hardworking Americans need is more ideology more gridlock or more partisanship they need solutions and maybe that's because of where I'm from they do maybe that's because where I'm from my dad was a union electrician he IBEW he wired buildings for a living he did 
honest work and when you do honest work you get a building that works you flip on a switch the lights go on you turn a faucet the water comes out one of the many problems with our president is he doesn't build anything he doesn't care if anything works he only cares about himself we need to ensure that America works for hardworking Americans we we do we need to elect a president who's committed to investing and improving public education in this country we need 
to elect a president who's committed to combating climate change to reforming our broken immigration system to investing in all communities including rural America and we're dealing with all of the change that's coming from technology but most importantly we need a president who is committed to creating universal health care in the United States of America where everyone gets health care as a basic right of citizenship no Americans should be 
worried about whether they can pay for their insulin or worry about their children's health care or worry about whether if they make a decision to get health care that they may be signing up to bankrupt themselves no Americans should worry about that and we know we can do this why do we know that because other countries have done it France has a universal health care system Sweden has a universal health care system the Netherlands has a universal health care 
system and Germany has a universal health care system so we can build a universal health care system in the wealthiest nation in the world but the one the one thing about all those countries whose systems we admire none of them have a single-payer universal health care system which shows there are lots of ways of creating universal health care in this country my plan better care gives every American health care as a right it invests in our 
communities in that we have high quality health care it puts money against basic research so we can cure cancer and cure Alzheimer's and it gives the American people what they want which is choices that's the best way forward on universal health care and so we need we need to become the party of ideas the party that embraces is debate the party that wants to build a big tent so that progressives who want change moderates who want solutions 
independents who just want their elected officials to put the country first and even those disaffected Republicans who look at this president and see that he has no moral compass and have turned their back on that party if we become that party we're gonna win every election and more importantly we'll be able to govern because whether it's creating universal health care or dealing with climate change or investing in communities that are left behind or 
rebuilding our infrastructure reforming our immigration system creating universal pre-k having more early childhood education making Community College free launching national service or dealing with all the blessings of Technology and making sure the American people are equipped to deal with it on all of these issues there's a common sense way forward and let's build that big coalition party and govern and lead this country god bless you thank you
