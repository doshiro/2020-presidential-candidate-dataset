[Applause] [Music] hello what a great crowd I am so glad to be here with you all today you know this is a perilous time for our country and every single day that goes by we see a new form of the risks posed to our country by a corrupt administration we woke up this morning to find out that at least 25 people in this administration had been denied security clearances yeah why oh because they had ties to foreign 
governments because they had conflicts of interest because they had financial problems that made them vulnerable and what does the President of the United States do instead of saying hey whoa my responsibility's watch out for the American people no these are friends these are people with money and with connections and the answer was just ran them on through you know the Trump administration is a walking talking living breathing threat to national 
security and we just have to call it it and that's what I want to talk about today I want to talk about corruption I want to talk about this cancer on our country corruption and opportunity look I see it this way yeah I was born out in Oklahoma and a family that didn't have much we were very much paycheck to paycheck my I have three older brothers I'm the Layton life baby often referred to as the surprised and by the time I was in middle school the boys as they 
are called to this day the boys were all off they had joined military and they were all off it was just my mom and my daddy and me and my daddy had a heart attack a really serious heart attack and we thought he was gonna die he pulled through but he couldn't go back to work so long time goes by we lose the family station wagon at night when I go to bed I hear my parents talking and that's when I learn words like mortgage and foreclosure and one day I walk into 
my parents bedroom and on the bed is the dress some of you know the dress it's the one that only comes out for weddings funerals and graduations and my mother's dinner slip and her stocking feet and she's pacing and she's saying we will not lose this house we will not lose this house we will not lose this house she's crying she's 50 years old she's never worked outside the home and she is truly terrified so she finally pulls it together puts on that dress puts on her 
high heels blows her nose and walks to the Sears where she gets a minimum-wage job now that minimum wage job saved our house and it saved our family and if you want to know who I am there's the story [Applause] and here's the thing for many years I thought that was a story just about my mother about how no matter how scared you are you reach down find what you need to find you pull it up and you do 
what has to be done to take care of the people you love what I discovered years later is it's the story of millions of families across this country people who reach down to what has to be done pull it up and take care of the people they love and it was only years after that that I understood it is also a story about government because when I was in middle school a full-time minimum-wage job with support a family of three today a minimum wage job in America 
full-time will not support a mama and a baby and keep them out of poverty I am in this fight because I want a government that cares a whole lot less about corporate profits and a whole lot more about families like ours now I made it on through school I got to live my dream I got to be a special needs teacher that was my life long let's hear it for America's teachers come on now I taught back in the day though and at the end of my first year 
in teaching I was visibly pregnant which meant the principal gave you a handshake wish you well and hired somebody else for the job that's how I ended up going to law school that's how I ended up becoming a lot I practice law for like 45 minutes and then made it straight back into teaching I traded the little ones for much taller students but always worked on one central question what's happening to working families in this country what's happening to opportunity 
in this country why is it that for millions of people it has gone wrong in this country so I look at this and here's what I discover it is not an accident it's not something that just happened on its own what's happened in America has been a series of deliberate decisions made in Washington understand it this way this government right now in Washington works great for giant drug companies 
just not for people who are trying to get a prescription filled yeah it works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for people who are worried about the impact of climate change that is bearing down on us it works great for giant financial institutions that are determined to make profits wherever they can just not for people forced into payday lending who are trying to make it paycheck to paycheck when a government works great 
for those at the top and for no one else that is corruption pure and simple and we have to call it out and the impact of that corruption is felt everywhere for a generation now adjusted for inflation incomes are basically flat in this country but what has happened to expenses the cost of housing up more than two-thirds the cost of a health insurance premium more than doubled the cost of sending a kid to school more than tripled the cost of child care up 
five times the squeeze on working families is real and the squeeze on families of color is deliberate let me let me just make one pitch here we've known for generations one way that working families build wealth is they do it by buying homes you know the advantage you get with a set depreciates overtime you get it paid off so it's no surprise to learn that starting back in the 1930s the US government started subsidizing the 
purchase of housing for white people for black people for brown people they discriminated it was called redlining and the consequence was by the 1960s there was a huge gap in home ownership between African Americans and whites so what happens we have a civil rights movement we say we're going to change all this we put money into housing and it gets a little bit better and then what happens a long term the big banks and they figure out that they can focus 
on communities of color take wealth out of those communities and just leave the devastation behind and where was our government our regulator's they were working great for the rich and the powerful just not for anyone else the consequence of that today the black white homeownership gap is larger than it was when housing discrimination was legal in this country think about that and assets for every hundred dollars of assets that a white family owns a black 
family owned somewhere around five dollars this is not an accident this is one deliberate policy in Washington after another and we have to call it out now that step one is to call it out step two is to say we are committed to make real change we are going to attack this corruption head-on I have the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate lots of parts to it I'll just tell you a couple and lobbying as we know it stop 
the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington and how about one more anybody who wants to run for federal office you got to put your tax returns on line [Applause] at at corruption head-on they're gonna play me off here but I'm gonna say two more things we got to rewrite the rules in this economy and that means more power in the hands of workers we need to make it easier to unionize and give 
those unions more power [Applause] and one more we need to rewrite the rules to protect our democracy I want to see a constitutional amendment to protect the right to vote and make sure every vote gets counted [Applause] 
morning good morning so you know Here I am I never thought that I would get into politics but I learned early on you don't get what you don't fight for and I'm in this because we have a Washington that works great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and I'm in this fight because I want to have a government that works better for everybody else that's why I'm here so let me just say how grateful I am to have the opportunity to be here with all 
of you rich trumka has been a fearless leader for this organization and also a great friend and I'm deeply grateful for that I also want to say a very special thank you to can say Garda Charlie Wishman to julienne fronts alone when I'm here with people who do the work every day I feel like I'm home so thank you you know there just one thing you need to know about me I want to I want to tell you about my my race right now there's just one thing you 
need to know I've done a hundred and twenty six town halls I've been to 26 states plus Puerto Rico I've spoken live to over 80,000 people and tens of thousands more people online and whatever's been covered in the media and every single time I have appeared at one of these town halls I have uttered this sentence unions built America's middle class and unions will rebuild America's middle class [Applause] 
I don't just say it when I show up in this room I say it every time because I believe it and I didn't just discover unions when I decided to run for president of the United States I've been putting my money where my mouth is for a long time on this my campaign staff is unionized with a union they picked I've helped other places unionize including the grad students in Boston the casino workers in Las Vegas airport workers in multiple cities I've walked picket lines 
and I've called CEOs to try to get them to settle disputes to try to get them to recognize unions that we're seeking recognition in other words I just want to say it this way if you're looking for a partner in the White House someone you can count on then that's who I will be [Applause] on every major decision unions will have a seat at the table whether we're talking about health care or trade or transportation or manufacturing policy 
unions will have a seat at the table and the reason for that is because I truly believe this is how we're going to fix what's broken in our economy so here's how I see it we have had a problem now for decades and the problem is the government in Washington is working great it's working fabulously for giant oil companies it's just not working for people who are worried about climate change it's working great for giant drug companies 
just not for people who are trying to get a prescription filled when you've got a government that works great for those who can hire armies and of lobbyists and lawyers and make huge campaign contributions and set up their own think tanks and bought and paid for experts but it's not working for working people that is corruption pure and simple and we need to call it out for what it is [Applause] 
corruption corruption that keeps this government working great for Big Pharma for big banks for big AG for big tech and not for working people so I got three ideas about what we do about that number one we have to attack the corruption head-on we've got to be willing to go after it call it out for what it is regardless of what party it is in and just say we're in all the way to fight it that we want a government that works for us here's the good news 
because money has felt everywhere in Washington here's the good news I now have the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate that's the good news here's the bad news we need the biggest anti-corruption bill since water cake it's just not working for us out there but let me tell you a couple of parts of it my bill says end lobbying as we know it block the revolving door between mains between Wall Street and Washington and 
just one more on that that I'll mention you really want to read out some corruption make every single person who runs for federal office put their tax returns online that's part one part two is we got to restructure the heart of this economy the problem we've got is too many giant corporations that are exercising more and more and more power power in this economy power in this government and raking off more and more of the profits so the way I see it is to 
get structural change you've got to get power back into the hands of workers that means make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate a second way we restructure this economy is it's time for a wealth tax in America yeah that's a 2 cent tax 2 cents on the top 1/10 of 1% of great fortunes in this country so here's how it is your first 50 million dollars in accumulated wealth you keep it free and 
clear I know some of you are saying but on your 50 million and first dollar you got a pitch in two cents and two cents for every dollar after that and what could we do with two cents in America we could provide universal child care for every baby in this country ages zero to five think what that would mean for young families the universal pre-k for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher 
the professional levels they deserve we can also with that money provide tuition free technical training two-year college four-year college for everybody who wants to get some more education we can help level the playing field put 50 billion dollars into our historically black colleges and universities and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the kids who have student loan debt outstanding you bet and one more thing we can do with that money there is 
enough money there that we can attack the opioid crisis head-on and bring it down a hundred billion dollars over the next ten years into defeating this enemy that is killing our brothers and sisters [Applause] we can do all of that we can attack the corruption we can restructure our economy and one more we can help protect our democracy we need a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote we need to make 
sure that every vote that is cast is as safe as Fort Knox not open to any Russian hackers or North Korean hackers or anybody else we need to we need to get rid of political gerrymandering so that democracy really works and roll back every racist voter suppression law in this country and just one more I want to mention overturn Citizens United democracy is not for sale [Applause] so this is what I'm fighting for 
I'm fighting for an America that doesn't just work for a thin slice at the top I'm fighting for an America that works for all of us and that means we've got to have an America where we attack the corruption head-on and America where we know to restructure this economy so all the profits aren't going to the top but they're going to the hardworking people who get it done and in America that protects it's democracy it is an honor to be here with you it is an honor to be 
a partner in this fight with you thank you all [Applause] 
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren hello Iowa Democrats I believe Democrats win when we talk about our values and here's an important one for me no matter where you live in America you ought to have a chance to build a secure future for yourself and your family and you ought to be able to count on a federal government that's on your side but for decades now in rural 
America in small-town America that just hasn't been the case and that's why a couple of days ago I rolled out an expanded plan for rural America and here's where it starts it starts with health care it starts with the importance of keeping our community hospitals and our doctors in business you know community loses its hospital young families can't move in and seniors feel like they have to leave so here's how I see this we start by with being 
willing to fight against Hospital mergers that cost us our local hospitals and we recognize the economics small hospitals operate on thin margins that means everybody who comes in the door needs to be covered by health care that's one of the reasons I support Medicare for all and we have to be willing to put in the resources to support our rural hospitals to make sure we've got enough doctors and nurses that medical service is available to everyone 
in this country all across this country part two of this plan is to make sure that we have access to high-speed Internet everywhere in America that's how you participate in a 21st century economy and part three we need a farm plan that works for independent farmers firm plans for too long have been about big AG we need to have the courage to break up big AG to fight against big AG to say no more sucking every last dollar out of the pockets of our independent 
farmers I support Supply Management and I say it's time for a new policy and innovative policy to bring in every single farmer make them part of the solution to climate crisis put them on the front lines these are the people who will help take care of our land for generations to come and help us have a habitable planet for generations to come and one more trade war bite wheat is not working for our farmers I promise you this when I'm president 
when I negotiate a trade deal there will be independent farmers at the table to make sure we get this right and one last point I want to make when I talk about structural change in our economy when I talk about the kind of changes we need to make it's so this economy works for everyone think about it this way we need more power in the hands of workers that means make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate and it's time for a wealth tax 
in this country two cents from the top one-tenth of 1% and we can have Universal childcare universal pre-k universal college fifty billion dollars in historically black colleges and universities and we can cancel stood alone depth for ninety-five percent of the folks who've got it we've had enough of an America where the government works better and better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top 2020 is our chance we can 
make this government work for all of America let's do this Democrats dream big fight hard let's win [Applause] 
hello Iowa I'm here to talk about something that people all across Iowa and all across America know down deep in their bones our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful they make it work for themselves and they leave everyone else behind we see it every time a corporate executive threatens to cut pay and move jobs overseas we see it every time an insurance company won't give people denies treatment and denies access to 
the doctors that people trust we see it when a criminal justice system tears apart black and brown families and the list goes on people crushed by student loan debt we see it over and over we see it when a when a gun industry prevents any any vote on sensible legislation that could save the lives of our children we see it when an oil industry continues to drill and calls all the shots in Washington that is corruption plain and simple and 
we need to be willing to call it out for what it is if we're going to make the big challenges of our time then it's going to take big structural change and that starts with you Iowa you know a lot of people are afraid of big structural change afraid because they're already rich and powerful and they may lose influence afraid because they built lives sucking up to those who are rich and powerful afraid because they see an America where they won't be 
able to make the changes they need afraid because they are either too cynical or too downtrodden to believe that change is possible well not me I believe in change and I know we can get it done and why do I know we can get it done because I've done it so I want to tell you a story about a toaster back when I was a young mom toasters could actually set houses on fire really um those little toaster ovens didn't have a shutoff 
switch so you could put in the bread hear the baby cry leave the room and come back and your toast would literally be in flames sometimes along with the kitchen curtains and the kitchen cabinets as well and then a federal agency stepped in and said enough you can't sell toasters in America that could have a 1 in 5 chance of burning down your house done no more toaster fires back by the early 2000s mortgages in this country had gotten so 
complicated and so dangerous that they had a 1 in 5 chance of costing a family their home not because of fire but because of foreclosure only this time this time the federal government was not on the side of the families it was deep in the pocket of the big banks in fact so deep in the pocket of the big banks that they permitted millions of those mortgages to be sold and they crashed our economy that was 2008 so I had an idea and the idea was a consumer agency 
that would protect people when they got mortgages or credit cards or payday loans the same way that other consumer agency had protected people when they bought toasters so here's the deal I went to Washington and I tried to talk to everybody I could about this idea and they told me two things almost everyone I talked to said the same two things first that is a great idea you could make a real difference that's structural change yes 
and the second thing was don't even try big money the big banks they will fight you the Republicans will fight you a bunch of the Democrats will fight you you will never get this done I get it big structural change is hard but it was the right thing to do so we took on Wall Street we took on the big money and we won and that little consumer agency has now forced the big banks to return more than twelve billion dollars directly to people they cheated we know how to make 
government work for the people so what did I learn from this fight I learned that notwithstanding what the billionaires will tell you what big egg or big banking or big pharma will tell you that if we're going to meet the challenges of our time we need big ideas big ideas big ideas to inspire people and get them out to caucus and get them out to vote make ideas to be the lifeblood of our party and show the world who and what Democrats will fight 
for big ideas to take back the Senate and put Mitch McConnell out of a job [Applause] we need big ideas and here's the critical part we need to be willing to fight for them it's easy to give up on a big idea but when we give up on big ideas we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas and those people are already in a fight people who are struggling to pay their medical bills 
are already in a fight people who are crushed by student loan debt are already in a fight people who are denied the chance to vote or stop by the police because of the color of their skin are already in a fight and those fights are all our fights look anyone who comes on this stage and doesn't understand that we're already in a fight is not the person who is going to win that fight [Applause] anyone who comes on this stage and tells 
you they can make change without a fight is not going to win that fight and anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory this is a time of crisis and media pundants Washington insiders even some people in our own party don't want to admit it they think that running some vague campaign that nibbles around the edges is somehow safe but if the most we can promise is business as usual after 
Donald Trump then Democrats will lose we win when we offer solutions big enough to touch the problems that are in people's lives fear and complacency does not win elections hope and courage wins elections I'm not running some consultant driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone I'm running a campaign based on a lifetime of fighting for working families I'm running a campaign from the heart 
because 2020 is our time in history 2020 is our time to win the fight for a green new deal and save planet 2020 is our time to win this fight for Medicare for all and save our people 2020 our time to win the fight for a two-cent wealth tax and invest in a whole generation 2020 is our time in history our time to dream big fight hard and win [Applause] you 

[Applause] oh good morning church good morning Rainbow PUSH it is so good to be here this morning it is good to be in the house of the Lord oh yes I am here this morning though because this country is in a time of crisis we are in a fight for the very soul of our nation and when we're in this kind of fight when we're in this kind of battle we need allies who know how to fight and who know how to win 
we need strong persistent fighters we not need fighters who know that giving up is not an option we need principled leaders who have the courage to fight for their convictions we need Giants who know that social change is possible only when we join together across lines of difference we need a champion like our Reverend Jesse Jackson thank you for generations under the leadership of our ever in Jeff C Jackson the national pushed Coalition 
has been on the front lines in the fight for justice I'm here today to let you know how proud I am to stand shoulder to shoulder with Reverend Jackson and with you in this fight and now more than ever the mission and mandate of Rainbow PUSH coalition is vitally important because here's the truth the fight for social racial and economic justice is far from over every day we wake up to a new attack attacks on our values attacks on our democracy 
attacks on the most vulnerable among us these fights are hard and at times it can seem like our labor is in vain but I'm here today to remind each and every one of you our fight is a righteous fight a righteous fight and in a righteous fight we fight until we win so I grew up out in Oklahoma grew up in the Methodist Church every Sunday in the Methodist Church my mother every Wednesday Methodist women's circle we know some of you on that right and oh 
when I had babies I took my babies to church now by this point I was down in Texas a little church down there and I tried to help out like most people do I bring a covered dish for our meetings sometimes we'd have them on Friday nights you could always count on me for costumes for the Christmas pageant or for the Easter pageant or whatever the kids were putting together but one day the pastor came up to me and he said he's Elizabeth 
he said I'd like you to teach Sunday school and I said oh I said Reverend I um you know I got little kids and I've got my own teaching job teaching and the laws but you know that goes and he said no he said I really like you to teach Sunday School he said the fifth graders he said we've had a teacher quit and he said we really need you to teach fifth grade Sunday school and I'm giving it the backpedal of the whole time and he said finally reaches out and grabs my 
arm II said no I really need you to teach Sunday school and I said well I bet maybe try some way he says it's the third teacher who's quit and I said is your problem in the fifth no he said look he said it's not that hard just so long as nobody gets hurt it'll be a success so I'm thinking whoa so I keep trying this and the pastor you know like Reverend Jackson he puts the arm on you you come through so there I am I show up to teach my fifth grade Sunday school 
class and I described this these kids are like man they are everywhere they are having a big time but not there to do much of a Sunday School lesson so in the space of the first two or three weeks they cut each other's hair that was a highlight they glue a bunch of stuff together including a bunch of our equipment and stuff in the room we're on the first floor fortunately because at one point all the little boys climbed out the window so 
it's a pretty chaotic mess and I finally decided you know this is awful I'm not doing a good job here there's one thing I do know how to do and it's teach come on I was a special needs teacher I'm now teaching in law school I could surely I can do this so I got my kids together finally about the fourth Sunday we did it I said okay look everybody sit down we're gonna read a story from the Bible and then I'm gonna ask you some questions about this so I gave them a 
little piece to read about Noah and so they all read about know and they're still giggling and twisted in the seats but they all read about Noah and I said how do you think Noah felt when he heard God and of course they give lots of giggling answers you know they give answers like and we're going crazy and you know he's it a spaceman talking to me but after a while they start to actually kind of get engaged what would that mean that God 
spoke directly to you and told you about something that was gonna happen in this world so they've got a little bit engaged and they started answering the questions and we made it through to juice time we passed out the juice some cookies in actually have a pretty good class so did it again the next week brought in a different story and started to ask him questions and they got more and more engaged we gave up doing the art we gave up cutting each other's hair 
and got focused on these Bible questions and so one day we were reading a passage about charity and and the children were struggling with the question about charity and the difference of charity what you give but you don't have to give but you need to think about what do you owe and that's kind of where the conversation turn so I was asking a question what do we owe each other not just give up of charity if you decide to what do you owe each other and so they 
go back and forth and they figure out some parts of it that are pretty good that you don't push your brother down okay I get that you know you don't hit kids I get another kid said you don't put boogers in your brother's food note to self don't eat at their house but I had one kid who was always pretty quiet he was bigger than the other kids but always pretty quiet kid named Jesse and Jesse didn't didn't volunteer too much I'm trying to draw him in and finally 
Jesse said I said you have an idea what we owe each other and Jesse said yeah he said everybody gets a turn and I thought yeah and he said everybody gets a turn and I I thought of that it's very much like the passage from Matthew so if you'll forgive me I know you know the passage but I want to remind everyone and see if we can we can we can link these up so I'm at Matthew 25 you ready Matthew here and I'm I'm old school so 
this gonna be King James Version okay and let me set this story up if there's anyone in here who doesn't know the story it's that the sheep are being divided from the goats and just so y'all understand sheep were going to heaven the goats most definitely are not and the Shepherd has divided them and he's put the sheep on one side and he's put the goats on the other and here's the passage and then he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the 
left then shall the King say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungry and he gave me meat I was thirsty and he gave me drink I was a stranger and he took me in naked and he clothed me I was sick and he visited me I was in prison and he came unto me and then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee 
drink the sheep are saying I don't remember seeing the Lord and doing these things for the Lord when saw we thee stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these the least of my brethren ye have done it unto me [Applause] and that for me it's what all of this is 
about for me there are three lessons in that passage the first is there is God in every one of us there is God in every one of us not God just in those who look like the Lord God in every one of us there is God in the children there is God in the hungry there is God in those who are in prison the second thing it says to me is that we are not called simply to observe we're not called just to have a good heart we are called to act to feed the hungry to bring water to 
the thirsty to visit the imprisoned and the third is that we are called to act without promise of reward we are called to act because it is right as I travel this country and I hear from the American people they share their struggles they share their fears they share their concerns but the people know what is right and they are ready to act they know that they have been called for such a time as this and they are willing to step up I am here today to say that 
none of us is alone in this fight when I am president we will answer this call together this is not a call for another round of empty promises this is not a call for another round of vague ideas this is a call for real plans to make real changes in our lives and in our communities and yes I have a plan for that too many for today but let me mention just a few to remind everyone some of you may know that I have proposed a two-cent wealth tax on the 
richest fortunes in this country two cents everything over fifty million dollars two cents and here's what we can do with two cents we can provide Universal child care for every one of our babies ages zero to six every one of them we can provide universal pre-k for every three-year-old and four-year-old in this country we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America we can make public technical school 
Community College and for years State College free to every one of our kids we can level the playing field and put fifty billion dollars into our historically black colleges and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the kids who got it yes we can begin to close the black-white wealth gap with these plans but there's so much more I have a plan to fund black entrepreneurs let's close the Entrepreneurship gap I have a plan to 
counter the effects of redlining I have a plan to end the mass incarceration of millions of our brothers and sisters by banning private prisons no one should make a profit from locking people up [Applause] I have a plan to make sure that every American citizen gets to vote and gets that vote counted yes this is a moment of tremendous challenge but I believe this is the moment we have been called to and I make 
you this promise when I am president we will answer this call together we will answer this call and we will stand with one another we will answer the call to make health care affordable housing and high quality education for every child a basic human right we will answer the call to build an America where the difference between a good education and a prison sentence isn't just a few blocks we will answer the call to make certain that every working person every 
working person regardless of race creed or economic background every working person is paid a living wage so they can build a secure future for themselves and their families we will answer the call to build an America that commits to educating our children before it criminalizes them we will answer the call to build an America where a run-in with law enforcement or a turn down the wrong street corner doesn't cost you your life because of the color of your 
skin we will answer the call to build an America where federal solutions to local problems are made by communities for Communities in communities where no one is forced to leave their community to find equal opportunity we will answer the call to end mass incarceration in this country and when I am president we will create a country in which like Matthew 25 every human being has value and we turn our backs on no one and we 
will start right here in Chicago [Applause] I know the challenges we face are enormous and the forces that stand against us will stop at nothing to divide us to turn us against each other in times of struggle in times of uncertainty I often turn to scripture for inspiration to keep the faith and to stay in the fight so for me it's second Timothy 4 God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of 
power and of love and of a sound mind I am in this fight because I am not afraid I know our fight is a righteous fight and if we stand together if we fight together if we persist together if we dream big and fight hard then we will win and we will make this the America
