work which in fact has gone on now for several years today is an extremely important day today we in the Senate have the opportunity to take a major step forward in ending the horrific war in Yemen and alleviating the terrible terrible suffering being experienced by the people in one of the poorest countries on earth and today equally important we can finally begin the process of reasserting Congress's responsibility 
over war making as every schoolchild should know article 1 of the Constitution clearly states that it is Congress not the president that has the power to declare war in their great wisdom the framers of our constitution the founders of this country gave that enormous Lee important responsibilities to Congress because the members of the House and the Senate are closer and more accountable to the people of this country tragically 
however over many years Congress has abdicated that responsibility through Democratic presidents and Republican presidents today we begin the process of reclaiming our constitutional authority by ending u.s. involvement in a war that has not been authorized by Congress and is clearly unconstitutional last assemble this body made history for the first time since the war powers resolution was passed in 1973 a majority of United States senators 56 of us in a 
bipartisan manner used those powers from the War Powers Act to end u.s. involvement in a war today we consider that exact same resolution once again in the new Congress this time however unlike last session this resolution will be brought to the House floor and I strongly believe will be passed let me say a brief word about the war in Yemen in March of 2015 under the leadership of Mohammed bin Salman then Saudi defense minister and now the 
Crown Prince a saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's ongoing civil war as a result of that intervention Yemen is now experiencing the worst humanitarian disaster on the planet according to the United Nations Yemen is at risk of the most severe famine in 100 years with some 14 million people facing the possibility of starvation in one of the poorest countries on earth as a result of this war according to the Save the Children organization some 85,000 
children in Yemen have already starved to death over the last several years an unimaginable number unimaginable suffering and destruction and if this war continues what the experts tell us is that millions more will also face famine and starvation further Yemen is currently experiencing the worst cholera outbreak in the world as many as 10,000 new cases each week according to the World Health Organization this is a disease spread by 
infected water that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration and will only accelerate the death rate the cholera outbreak has occurred because Saudi bombs have destroyed Yemen's water infrastructure and people are no longer able to access clean drinking water the fact is that the United States with little media attention has been Saudi Arabia's partner in this horrific war we have 
been providing the bombs that the saudi-led coalition is using we have been refueling their planes before they drop those bombs and we have been assisting with intelligence in too many cases our weapons are being used to kill civilians in August it was an american-made bomb that obliterated a school bus full of young boys killing dozens and wounding many more a CNN report found evidence that American what weapons have been used in a string of 
such deadly attacks on civilians since the war began this past weekend this past weekend at least 20 women and a child were killed in a saudi-led air strike on Yemen's northwestern province of haja as they huddled in a house to avoid nearby clashes as is so often the case in war the innocent the women and the children paid the price late last year I met with several brave Yemeni human rights activists they had come to Congress to urge us to put a stop to 
this war and they told me clearly when Yemenis see made in America on the bombs that are killing them it tells them that the United States is responsible for this war that is the sad truth mr. president the bottom line is that the United States should not be supporting a catastrophic war led by a despotic regime with a dangerous and irresponsible foreign policy some have suggested that Congress that Congress 
moving to withdraw support from this war would undermine the United Nations efforts to reach a peace agreement but the opposite is true it is the promise of unconditional US support for the Saudis that undermines those efforts and we have evidence for this late the sent last assembled as we were preparing to vote on this same resolution we receive news that UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths reached a breakthrough agreement for a ceasefire in the port 
city of add item and that ceasefire which is being maintained today is enabling food and increased humanitarian aid into the country I have spoken to people at the highest level of those negotiations who have made it clear that our actions here in the Senate played a significant role in pushing Saudi Arabia toward an agreement that pressure must continue and the resolution that I hope we pass today will do just that so our effort on this issue has clearly made a 
positive impact and I thank all of the co-sponsors of this resolution for their efforts and all of the civil society organizations progressive and conservative organizations who have worked so hard to raise awareness of this conflict and the constitutional implications the president above and beyond the humanitarian crisis in Yemen this wall has been harmful to our national security and the security of the region the administration defends 
our engagement in Yemen by overstating Iranian support for the Houthi rebels let me be clear Iran's support for the Houthis is of concei rias concern for all of us but the truth is that support there is far less significant than the administration claims and the fact is that the relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only been strengthened by this war the war is creating the very problem the administration claims to want to solve this war is also 
undermining the broader effort against violent extremists a 2016 State Department report found that the conflict had helped al Qaeda and the Islamic states Yemen branch quote deepen their inroads across much of the country and the court as the head of the International Rescue Committee former British Foreign Minister David Milliband said in a recent interview quote the winners are the extremist groups like Al Qaeda and Isis end of quote 
late last year The Wall Street Journal reported and I quote nearly two years after being driven from its stronghold in Yemen one of al-qaeda's most dangerous franchises has entrenched himself in the country's hinterlands as a devastating war creates the conditions for its comeback end of quote and here is something that should deeply concern us all at a time when we are spending billions to fight terrorism all over the world 
a February CNN report revealed that Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have transferred american-made weapons to Al qaeda-linked fighters in Yemen does anyone here think it makes sense that US weapons should be given to groups who have declared war against the United States so this war is was a humanitarian and a strategic disaster and let us also not forget that this war is being led by a despotic undemocratic regime in Saudi 
Arabia the United States of America the most powerful country on Earth should not be led into a regional war by our client states who are trying to serve their own narrow and selfish interest it should not be Saudi Arabia that is developing and implementing American foreign and military policy Saudi Arabia is a monarchy controlled by one of the wealthiest families in the world the Saud family and a 2017 report by the Cato Institute Saudi Arabia was ranked a 
hundred and forty nine out of a hundred and fifty nine countries for freedom and human rights is this really the kind of country whose foreign policy we should be supporting with US taxpayer dollars for decades the Saudis have funded schools mosques and preachers who promote an extreme form of Islam Don is Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia today women are treated as third-class citizens women still need the permission of a male guardian to go to school or get a 
job they have to follow a strict dress code and can be stoned to death for adultery or flawed for spending time in the company of a man who was not their relative last year saw the Saudi activists Lou Jane I'll have well a leader in the fight for women's rights was kidnapped from Abu Dhabi and forced to return to the country she is currently imprisoned along with many other human rights activists Human 
Rights Watch reported and imprisoned women activists have been subjected to torture including electric shocks and other forms of physical and sexual assault the people of the entire world received a very clear understanding about the nature of the Saudi regime with the murder of Jamal khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey all of the evidence suggests that the Saudi Crown Prince was directly responsible for that murder is that really the kind of regime 
whose leads we in the United States should be following mr. president I believe that the US Congress has become far too comfortable with military interventions all over the world we have now been in Afghanistan for nearly 18 years longest war in American history we also have troops in many other countries around the world the time is long overdue for Congress to reassert its constitutional role in determining when and where our country goes to war this 
resolution provides that opportunity and I hope this body will do exactly as it did in December and in a bipartisan manner pass this resolution the humanitarian catastrophe has only gotten worse in Yemen and our intervention there is every bit as unconstitutional as it was when we passed this resolution in December let us bring this catastrophic war in Yemen to an end let us focus our efforts on the diplomatic on a diplomatic 
resolution to end that war and let us provide the humanitarian aid needed to protect the hungry and the sick in Yemen and let us today in an historic vote 45 years after the passage of the War Powers Act let us today reassert Congress's constitutional responsibility in terms of war making Thank You mr. president and I yield the floor mr. president the senator from Connecticut thank you very much mr. president I am very pleased 
once again to join my friend and senator from Vermont on the floor to press this body to take seriously its constitutional responsibility and its responsibility to assure that the United States doesn't enter into hostilities abroad other than those situations that are vitally necessary to protect our national security interests and I am so proud to have 
hi I'm Bernie Sanders I'm running for president and I'm asking you today to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign of 1 million active volunteers in every state in our country our campaign is not only about the feeding Donald Trump the most dangerous president in modern American history it is not only about winning the Democratic nomination in the general election our campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based 
on the principles of economic social racial and environmental justice our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interest that dominate our economic and political life I'm talking about Wall Street the health insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the private prison industry and the large multinational corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives our campaign is about 
redoubling our efforts to end racism sexism homophobia religious bigotry and all forms of discrimination our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country on earth while we end voter suppression citizens united and outrageous levels of gerrymandering our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many not just the few we are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world we 
should not have a grotesque level of wealth inequality in which three billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country we should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance even more who are underinsured and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline we should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have savings as they face retirement we 
should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children we should not have a regressive tax system in which large profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes make no mistake about it the powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo they 
have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties the only way we will win this election and create a government and an economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement the likes of which has never been seen in American history they may have the money and the power we have the people that is why we need 1 million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign you know as 
well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history we are running against a president who is a pathological liar a fraud a racist a sexist a xenophobe and someone who was undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction I am running for president because now more than ever we need leadership that brings us together not divides us up women and men black white Latino Native American Asian 
American gay and straight young and old native-born and immigrant now is the time for us to stand together I'm running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class not just the 1% we need a president in wonder stands the we can create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and constructing the affordable housing we desperately need I 
am running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multinational corporations we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave I'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers not just corporate America and those who own 
that technology I'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has but by how it treats the most vulnerable the elderly the children our veterans the sick in the poor I'm running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science not politics we need a president who understands that climate change is real is an existential threat to our country 
and the entire planet and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy I'm running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege through a Medicare for All single-payer program I am running for president because we need to 
take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country I'm running for president because we need to have the best educated workforce in the world it is totally counterproductive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt while men others cannot afford the high cost of higher education that is why we need to 
make public colleges and universities tuition-free and lower student debt I am running for president because we need real criminal justice reform we need to invest in jobs and education for our kids not more jails and incarceration we need to end the destructive war on drugs private prisons and cash bail and bring about nature Police Department reform I'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country 
and move the comprehensive immigration reform we need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the daca program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum I'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country we need to take on the NRA expand background checks and the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons I am 
running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy human rights diplomacy and world peace the United States must leave the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change militarism authoritarianism and global wealth inequality that is why we need 1 million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish all of these goals needless 
to say there is a lot of frightening and bad work the bad news in this world now let me give you some very good news that we should all be very proud of three years ago during our 2016 campaign when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were radical and were extreme we were told that medicare-for-all a $15 an hour minimum wage free tuition at public colleges and universities aggressively combating 
climate change demanding that the wealthy stop paying their fair share of taxes we were told that all of these concepts were ideas that the American people would never accept well three years have come and gone and as a result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans together you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution now it is time to complete 
that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for so here is my question for you will you stand with me as part of a million-person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic nomination not only win the general election but most importantly help transform this country so that finally we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for 
peace and for economic racial social and environmental justice and together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country brothers and sisters if we stand together there is no limit to what we can accomplish I hope you'll join me thank you very much 
it is an honor and a pleasure to be here with you and I will tell you why because you guys are doing exactly what has to be done in this country you are organizing at the grassroots level you are standing up and fighting back against Trump's racism and sexism and homophobia and religious bigotry you are fighting for a government that represents all of us and not just the 1% thank you very much for what you're doing the crisis that we are facing 
today is not complicated it has everything to do that we have a government that ignores the needs of working people ignores the needs of minorities ignores the needs of women yet works over time for wealthy campaign contributors and the 1% and what our job is is not radical it's what the American people want they want a government which represents all of us not just the people on top so thank you for helping to lead that fight now in the midst of a lot of 
bad news that comes from the White House I want to give you some good news and that is we have come a long way over the last four years and you guys are part of the progress that we have made let me give you let me give you some examples four years ago when I ran for president and some of us were talking about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour we were told we were crazy it was a radical idea remember that imagine doubling the federal minimum wage well 
guess what's happened six states have already voted to raise that minimum wage and a few weeks ago the US House of Representatives Committee on education and labor voted out of committee a bill to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour few years ago we were saying you know we're living in a competitive global economy and if this economy is going to be successful for working people everybody in this country regardless of income has the right to 
get a higher education people said oh my god that's just too radical can't be done in the last four years all over this country cities and states are moving to making public colleges and universities tuition-free and two [Applause] substantially and this is what our job is we are going to substantially if not completely end the outrage of millions of Americans dealing with student debt in this country 
[Music] and four years ago we had a real you really want to hear really radical and crazy idea I mean so radical are you hesitate to bring it forward imagine you know the establishment when crazy media went nuts killers imagine the United States joining the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee health care to all people as a right not a privilege well we've come a really long way it was a radical idea four 
years ago poll after poll shows a majority of Americans support that idea as well alright four years ago we were talking about the ugliness vulgarity of the United States having more people in jail than any other country on earth disproportionately African American Latino and Native American and we said that maybe instead of investing in jails and incarceration we should invest in our young people in jobs and education well we are beginning to see beginning 
we had a long way to go all over the country good people standing up and saying our goal is not to have more people in jail it is to have fewer people in jail and when we talk about criminal justice reform we have to talk about ending the war on drugs four years ago it was a radical idea to say maybe we should legalize or decriminalize the possession of marijuana well four years have come and gone and guess what state after state including the state of 
Vermont DC have done just that four years ago there weren't many voices out there they were talking about a corrupt political system in which billionaires are able to buy elections and that maybe we should move to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of Elections four years ago there was not a whole lot of discussion about the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in America where three families today bleep listen 
to this three families own more wealth than the bottom half of the American people and at a time when millions of families people are working two or three jobs 46 percent of all new income is going to the top one percent so what we said and I think more and more people are saying it now maybe instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires and large private corporations maybe we should demand that the wealthy and profitable corporations start paying 
their fair share of taxes the mantra of our campaign is not me but us and the reason for that is not just that it sounds like a good bumper sticker the reason for that for that is the simple that's the simple truth no president no matter how well-intentioned or honest he or she may be can do it alone so I'm going to tell you what very few people will tell you is that the power of Wall Street the power of the fossil 
fuel industry who lies to us every day about climate change the power of the insurance companies of the pharmaceutical companies of the military-industrial complex that power is so great that the only way we defeated is when millions of people black and white and Latino Native American Asian American gay and straight immigrant and native one unless we come together and say to trump that those days of hatred and 
division divisiveness is over we're going to bring our country together to fight for an agenda that works for all of us and not just the people on top thank you very much

black and white Latino asian-american Native American gay straight [Music] [Applause] we transform this country [Applause] if I might take a moment as I return here to the area that I was bought let me say a few personal words as we watch this campaign for president you deserve to know where I came from because family history obviously heavily influences the 
values that we developed as adults I was born literally a few miles away from here on East 26th Street in Kings Highway [Music] and mine lived in a dream half room rent controlled apartment [Music] my father was a paint salesman who were caught his entire life but never made much money and my mother raised my brother and me I learned a great deal 
about immigration as a child because my father preponed at the age of 17 without nickel without knowing one word he came to the United States to escape the crushing poverty that existed in his community and to escape widespread anti-semitism and was good that he came to this because virtually his entire family was wiped out by Hitler and Nazi bombers I am NOT going to tell you [Music] 
a desperate company cannot be true but what I'm going to tell you is that coming from a middle-class family about money or really lack of money was always a point of stress in our family my mother's dream was that someday rent controlled apartment to a home that tree was never fulfilled she died while we still live in that control of the park my experience as a child living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my 
values I know where my [Music] something I will never [Applause] I like Donald Trump who shut down the government and left 800,000 federal employees without income to pay [Applause] I know what it's like to be in a family that lives paycheck to paycheck now it is true I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build three 
skyscrapers casinos and country clubs I did not come from a family that gave me a $200,000 allowance every year beginning at the age of three [Applause] as I recall my allowance was 25 cents a week but I had something would I had the role model of a father who had unbelievable courage in German across an ocean with no money in his pocket to saw a new and better life I did not come from a family 
of privilege that prepared me to entertain people on television by telling workers you're fired I came from a family who knew all too well the frightening power employers can have over everyday workers I did not come from a family that could afford to send my brother and me to an elite boarding school in fact I was educated probably in high quality public schools in begin my higher education right here [Applause] 
I should also mention that my brother Larry graduated from Brooklyn College [Applause] [Music] that taught me to build a corporate empire through one of the proudest days of my life was attending the march on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by dr. boninger brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and I and millions of Americans have fought for justice in 
every part of our society and we've had some successes together as billionaires and watch corporations of attack unions destroyed pensions deregulated the banks and slashed wages we have succeeded in reins in the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour in states and cities together we lost Amazon and the Disney Corporation to do the same [Applause] [Music] 
[Applause] [Music] together is the forces of militarism have kept us engaged in never-ending Wars we have stood together and fought back for the first time in forty five years we have utilized the War Powers arm to move us forward to end the horrific saudi-led war in Yemen so many of our young people have received criminal records for nonviolent offenses we have fought to end the war on drugs 
and I've seen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have won some victories but clearly we have a long long way to go and I am here to tell you that because all of the work we have done together we are on the brink of not just being an election but transpose [Applause] 
[Music] when we are in the White House we will not be Federal jobs guaranteed to ensure that everyone in this country is guaranteed to be done in this country we will attack the problem of urban gentrification [Music] and give the affordable housing this country desperately needs we are in the white house we will end of America we will have decent jobs 
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] the common-sense gun safety legislation that the overwhelming majority of Americans wanna see we're going to address not only the national disparities of wealth and income but the racial disparities we are going together to institutional racism [Music] [Music] 
[Applause] we please make no mistake about the struggle that we are undertake is not just about the feeding Donna trouble this struggle is about saving on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of our nation [Music] [Applause] [Music] the true publicist 
military complex [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us will not be everything they will do to defend their financial interests [Music] [Applause] [Music] 
[Applause] this is what I believe from the bottom of my head if we do not allow Trump and his friends to divide us up if we stand together black white Latino Asian American native the Bourbon if we say together and move north south east and west if we stand together not as red states and blue states working we believe in justice and human if we stand together in love and compassion if we stand together brothers and sisters 
the future of this country is extraordinary and there is nothing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] 
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage Vermont senator Bernie Sanders [Applause] thank you all very much my wife Jane let me thank all of the people in this room for the important work you are doing every single day together here in Iowa and all across this country we will defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country together we will end the racism in the sexism in the Islamic 
obeah and the homophobia and all the other phobias that this president exhibits and we will end white nationalism in this country as well [Applause] together we will protect American democracy and the rule of law and together we will create an economy and a government that works for all and not just the 1% but let me be as clear as I can be we will not defeat Trump unless we have 
an agenda that speaks to the pain and reality of the working families of this country millions of whom are working longer hours for lower wages we will not defeat Trump unless we have the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests who dominate our economic and political life the American people want are begging Congress for common-sense gun safety legislation and that is why we have to have the courage to take on the NRA the 
American people understand that climate change is real and that is causing devastating problems in our country and all over the world and that is why we have to have the courage to take on the greed and recklessness of the fossil fuel industry the American people understand that in the year 2019 we must make public colleges and universities tuition-free and cancel all student debt in this country but in order to do that we are going to have to end an absurd 
tax system that allows Wall Street and major corporations to get huge tax breaks and the American people understand increasingly more and more every day that health care is a human right not a privilege and every poll that I have seen tells me that the American people agree with many of us in this room that we must pass Medicare for all but to do that we are going to have to take on the pharmaceutical industry which charges us the highest prices in 
the world for the medicine that we need to do that we are going to have to take on the whole health care industry which made a hundred billion dollar in profit last year and the only way I know how we take on Wall Street and the drug companies and the insurance companies and the fossil fuel industry in the NRA is when we have an unprecedented grassroots movement of millions of Americans standing up fighting back and demanding an economy 
and a government that works for all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors brothers and sisters brothers and sisters in this unprecedented moment in American history we need an unprecedented grassroots movement join our effort and let us reclaim American democracy and the government a government that works for all people thank you all very much [Applause]
