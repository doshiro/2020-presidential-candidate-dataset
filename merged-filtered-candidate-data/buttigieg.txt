The Chinese Communist Party�s repressive treatment of the Uighurs and other minorities, and growing pressure on Hong Kong, are symptomatic of a broader, and intensifying, �systems� competition. Beijing seems committed to consolidating and legitimizing authoritarian capitalism as an alternative to the democratic capitalism embraced by the United States and its closest allies and partners. 
Where necessary and feasible, we should seek cooperation with Beijing, such as in addressing climate disruption, maintaining strategic stability, combatting terrorism, and managing conflict through international peacekeeping. But the United States must defend our fundamental values, core interests, and critical alliances, and accept that this will often entail friction with China.
For too long we have underestimated China�s ambitions, while overestimating our ability to shape them. We must instead focus on repairing our democracy and reinvesting in our economic and technological competitiveness; inoculating open societies from corrupt, coercive, or covert political interference; strengthening, rather than straining, our alliances in order to put collective pressure on China for unfair economic practices, human rights abuses, and intimidation of countries that stand up for their sovereignty; realigning defense and other national security investments to reflect China�s military modernization and full-spectrum statecraft; and reducing vulnerabilities from economic interdependence by disentangling the most sensitive sectors of our economies--in an orderly, not chaotic, fashion--and ensuring that American and allied resources and technologies do not underpin authoritarian oppression and surveillance. 
I have been clear: walking away from the JCPOA was a strategic mistake. We didn�t develop the deal as a favor to Iran; we did it because it was in our national security interest. The deal represented a detailed and verifiable arrangement that permanently prohibited Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And the JCPOA was effective: Iran was upholding its commitments, as confirmed repeatedly by international inspectors and our own intelligence community, when President Trump withdrew from it. Walking away from the JCPOA also cost us credibility and the trust of our partners, hindering our ability to work with allies to solve difficult collective challenges. 
We should have no illusions about the reality that Iran poses challenges to U.S. interests beyond its nuclear program: its ballistic missile program, malign behavior in the region, threats to our ally Israel, and human rights abuses. But having the JCPOA in place created a foundation from which we could begin addressing those concerns, all of which will be even more intractable if we lack a mechanism to verifiably and permanently prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. 
If Iran resumes implementing its commitments, then I would rejoin. But I would take the agreement as a floor, not a ceiling. I would revive P5+1 diplomacy and direct US-Iran dialogue at the appropriate levels and would want to pursue follow-on agreements that extend the timeframe of certain nuclear restrictions, cover Iran�s missile program, and address its role in regional conflicts, all in return for targeted sanctions relief. 
We have to accept that denuclearization will not happen overnight and will require a sustained, step-by-step approach spanning a significant number of years. It is unrealistic to think that the North Koreans will get rid of their entire nuclear weapons stockpile at the outset. I believe the most realistic way to get there is a framework for complete, verifiable denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula that is comprehensive in scope, with steps on both fronts implemented step-by-step and in tandem. 
I would support an initial freeze agreement that would have North Korea cease production of fissile material and end nuclear and missile testing, all verified by international inspectors, in exchange for targeted sanctions relief, which could be reversed if the North Koreans did not uphold their end of the bargain. After this initial deal, we would need to proceed toward dismantling facilities and then the weapons themselves.  This could be accompanied with corresponding measures on sanctions relief, as well as substantive progress on building a lasting peace regime and normalizing relations. It has to be a two-way street. The only way to achieve complete denuclearization is to recognize that we have to address the core issues of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula in tandem, and that will require concrete steps on both sides. 
Russian aggression against Ukraine is an attack on the agreed principles and rules of European and global order that protect global citizens beyond Ukraine, including Americans.  Ukraine�s sovereignty and territorial integrity is protected by the UN Charter and European security agreements, which the Russian Federation has signed and is obligated to respect.  The OSCE mission and Minsk agreement both obligate Russia to resolve the conflict peacefully with Ukraine. We must keep tough, targeted, and effective economic and financial sanctions on Russia as long as it continues to assault Ukrainian territory and citizens, and continues to illegally occupy Ukrainian territory in the Donbas and Crimea.
But countering Russian aggression  also means supporting Ukraine�s independence and ability to make and implement sovereign foreign policy decisions by supporting Ukraine�s political, economic, and defense capabilities. Although Ukraine is not a formal treaty ally, the U.S. should be willing to help Ukraine develop a modern and capable defense force to defend its citizens, including advice, education, training, and willingness to consider commercial sales of weapons appropriate to the situation.   While the US must not exacerbate instability or conflict, we should not shy from responsible defense assistance to a democracy in the heart of Europe that is under assault because its citizens have chosen a democratic European path.
I�ve seen first-hand the costs of our long conflict in Afghanistan. It�s time to end this endless war. The only question is do we do it well or poorly. 
Our objective has remained the same throughout this conflict: ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a base for terrorist attacks against the US or its allies.  A negotiated peace agreement in which we maintain a relevant special operations/intelligence presence but bring home our ground troops is the best way to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a base for terrorist attacks against the United States or its allies. Using our current presence to help lock in a peace agreement should be part of that strategy.  
The United States must halt military support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen. The brutal war has brought the country to the verge of famine and killed tens of thousands of civilians. As president, I would suspend all arms sales to Saudi Arabia that could be used in the Yemen war, but also cut off the spare parts and maintenance for equipment needed to prolong that war. Ending our own involvement in the war in Yemen is just a first step. We need to increase our diplomatic efforts and work with our allies to end the conflict itself, which has generated the world�s worst humanitarian crisis and helped to spread extremism. 
We must also reset our relationship with Saudi Arabia, so that our interests and values drive the relationship -- not the other way around. Our strongest alliances must be founded upon shared commitments to international law and human rights. We must be pragmatic about intelligence-sharing: totally stopping such cooperation could hinder our ability to detect and thwart threats emanating from Yemen, including from the regional al-Qaeda affiliate.   But the Saudi government should not get a pass on the state-sponsored murder of an American resident abroad, nor should they be able to buy our silence on human rights abuses -- including killing civilians in Yemen and supporting extremist ideology across the Muslim world -- through purchases of US weapons.
Yes, I do support a two-state solution. The US alliance with Israel and support for Israel�s security have long been fundamental tenets of US national security policy, and they will remain so if I am elected President. But this is not a zero-sum game. The security of Israel and the aspirations of the Palestinian people are fundamentally interlinked. To visit the West Bank and Gaza is to understand the fundamental need for a two-state solution which addresses the economic, security and moral rights of both Israelis and of the Palestinians who live there.
I have clearly and strongly stated my support for the security of Israel, and I have also said that I disagree with policies being carried out by the current Israeli administration. This includes overreach in the West Bank and Gaza and short-sighted focus on military responses. The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza has gone on far too long and provides a ripe environment for the very extremist violence that threatens Israel.
The United States needs to put its arm around the shoulder of its ally, Israel, and help it to develop policies that will work towards the economic and security benefit of both Israel and the Palestinians. Both Israeli and Palestinian citizens should be able to enjoy the freedom to go about their daily lives without fear of rocket attacks or other violence, and to work to achieve economic well-being for their families. A two-state solution that achieves legitimate Palestinian aspirations and meets Israel�s security needs remains the only viable way forward.
Maduro is responsible for the humanitarian crisis that has seen more than four million Venezuelans flee their country. Endemic corruption, pervasive criminality among top officials, and systematic human rights abuses all reinforce the fact that the Maduro regime has lost the legitimacy to govern, and I stand behind Juan Guaid� as the rightful interim president. Our end state in Venezuela is a peaceful transfer of power to an interim constitutional government followed by free and fair elections. Because the refugee situation and Venezuela's imploding economy are impacting the entire hemisphere, the U.S. government should respond in concert with our regional allies, who are shouldering the heavy burden of a large Venezuelan diaspora.  Together, we also need to address the Russian, Chinese and Cuban interference now complicating an effective transition.
In this vein, I support recent efforts to negotiate a settlement between the regime and Guaid�; such talks can be the best route to a managed transition.  I would also continue to apply targeted sanctions against regime officials -- but broad economic sanctions, such as those pursued by the Trump administration, run the risk of hurting innocent Venezuelans already face crippling food and medicine shortages and enabling the Maduro regime to promote the false narrative that the U.S. is responsible for the country's misery. I also would support extending Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans currently residing in the United States until the crisis is resolved. 
Africa is not a country, it is a diverse and multifaceted continent of states with rich and proud histories, great successes, and significant and varied challenges.  On that continent, the winds of change are sweeping aside old regimes and certitudes. In Algeria, a new generation has risen up against a sclerotic government. In Sudan, women have led a revolt against a criminal one. And in Ethiopia, we have seen what can look like when hope triumphs over hostility.
By 2025, nearly one-fifth of the world�s population will live in the nations of a rising Africa--60 percent of whose people are now under the age of 25. Our priorities should include cooperation on helping our African partners manage that population growth: accountable governance, climate change mitigation and conflict prevention. 
We must also prioritize building shared prosperity that can assist new generations in having a viable and productive future.  That continent now boasts some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, which have lifted millions out of poverty and into the global marketplace.  Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the biggest opportunities for new markets for US goods and investment. And as African peoples demand greater accountability and transparency from their leaders, the United States must stand ready to put our values into action, to promote empowerment alongside economic engagement.  
I would not support the US joining the current CPTPP. It lacks critical trade provisions on labor, environment, and the digital economy, and does not align closely enough with the needs and interests of American workers. We must address failures in delivering on the social compact here at home. For too long, Washington sold trade deal after trade deal with the promise that a rising tide would lift all boats. It hasn�t � in part because it wasn�t accompanied by investment here at home � and Washington failed those left behind.
A lot of Americans just don�t trust the government to negotiate trade deals in their best interest. We need an honest national discussion about trade. Our work must begin at home. At the same time, we should not surrender the world�s fastest growing markets in Asia to other nations. It is where China wants to dominate and is buying influence through their Belt and Road initiative. China is negotiating broad new trade agreements with their neighbors that favor China�s economy and workers. These agreements also enshrine non-democratic principles at the expense of the US and free people. Sitting on the sidelines is a losing proposition for America.
We cannot just put up walls around our economy. We need to be setting the rules of the road for the future, so that strategic and economic competition with China happens on our terms.
The US needs to lead the way in the global exit of coal-fired power� a process already underway. First, as President, I will quadruple clean energy research and development in the US and enact additional policies to support the deployment of renewables, storage, carbon capture and energy efficiency in homes and building retrofits. Second, I would also convene local leaders from across the globe at a Pittsburgh Climate Summit to commit to decisive action within their communities and create local initiatives to deploy clean energy policy and technologies that will continue to drive down the price of clean energy and move on from coal. Third, the US will work through global institutions to reduce and end global fossil fuel subsidies, many of which have unfairly favored coal, starting at home. Finally, the US can leverage trade agreements to reduce the amount of coal funded through China's Belt and Road initiative.
After intense political debates in the years after WWII between isolationists and internationalists, I believe America�s greatest foreign policy accomplishment has been our leadership of global efforts to promote the values that animate our own and other great democracies, to the benefit of the security and freedom of our people. From the design, implementation and success of the Marshall Plan to the fall of the Soviet Union, our leadership � until recently � has been based not only on our power but also on the ideals of America and our allies. 
Our biggest mistake has been the failure to use our leadership more vigorously in key areas of international change: to bend the benefits of globalization more equitably to improving the everyday lives of poor and middle-class citizens, especially women and minorities, in our own and other nations; to combat climate change and nuclear proliferation; and to stand strong against the recent surge of anti-democratic forces around the world.  I often think of how the resources used for unnecessary, prolonged wars that were not in our interest could have been used in addressing these issues to the benefit of our own people and the entire world.
When you come from a family of educators like I do, you know the power of learning to open new horizons and opportunities. As our world and our economy change, access to ongoing higher education is increasingly necessary to thrive. But for too many Americans that opportunity is out of reach.
For many Americans, college has been a pathway to the middle class. Yet today, it costs students and their families more than ever. The federal Pell Grant used to cover nearly 80 percent of the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board; today, it covers just 29 percent.1 The average graduate with a bachelor�s degree starts their life with around $30,000 of debt.2

When you come from a family of educators like I do, you know the power of learning to open new horizons and opportunities. As our world and our economy change, access to ongoing higher education is also increasingly necessary to thrive. For too many Americans, however, that opportunity is out of reach.
A college degree has long been a ticket to well-paying jobs and fulfilling post-graduate opportunities�and for many Americans, a pathway to the middle class. But today, college costs students and their families more than ever before. States have cut investments in higher education and federal student aid doesn�t stretch as far as it once did. The federal Pell Grant used to cover nearly 80 percent of the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board; today, it covers just 29 percent. The average graduate with a bachelor�s degree starts their life with around $30,000 in debt.
And more than 40 percent of students don�t even make it to graduation. Students who drop out with debt but no degree are significantly more likely to struggle with loan repayment, and may even default. Others graduate from predatory, for-profit colleges that take students� tuition money without providing them a quality education.
But opportunities for success shouldn�t be limited to those with a college degree in America. As important as it is to make college affordable, it must also be possible to land a well-paying job and launch a career for those Americans who do not go to college. As our labor market changes and evolves, well-paying jobs and careers requiring only a high school diploma are harder to find. With systematic reductions in worker power and significant cuts to workforce investment and technical education, Americans have been left behind. We need to ensure that workers have access to the training and education that will make them�and our economy�successful. Having more affordable and high-quality options to get there, inside and outside of traditional college, is critical.
Our ability to compete internationally, to innovate and grow our economy, to sustain and expand our middle class, and to make sure children have a better life than their parents, will be shaped in many ways by the education we make available to Americans�whether they choose to go to college or not Last winter, after my father entered a hospitalization from which he would never emerge, my mother and
I sat down with a social worker to talk about options for the long-term care we thought he might need. I�ll always remember the social worker patiently explaining to my mom that her best option to cover Dad�scare might be for our family to spend everything that we had until we were asset-poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. I remember thinking, �Is that how this works in America?�
It is a fact of life that we and the people we love grow older. With aging can come deep satisfaction and joy--the chance to slow down, or travel, or play with a new grandchild. It can also bring hardship, as a worker frets whether she has sufficient savings to retire or a husband weighs whether to move his spouse to a nursing home.
More and more Americans are confronting the challenges of aging, as Baby Boomers continue to approach retirement. After full careers, many Americans continue working longer because they can�t afford to retire. For the first time in our nation�s history, there will be more older adults than children.1 In 2020, half of adults who reach 65 will require long-term care.2 By 2026, we will require 7.8 million new care jobs. At the same time, more and more Americans are becoming eligible for Social Security�even as the Trump Administration has attempted to undermine Americans� retirement by cutting billions of dollars from Social Security over the next decade.3 Politicians in Washington have known this crisis was intensifying for years. And for years, they have failed to address it. It is time for a new approach.
I am determined to usher in a new era for older Americans, one that empowers them to age and retire with dignity. One that equips them and their families with a sense of security over their futures, allowing them to see it as a time filled with possibility.
In this new era, we will uphold that unshakable promise that every American should be able to maintain a decent standard of living when they retire. We will honor and support our nation�s caregivers�who are primarily women and disproportionately Black, Latino, and immigrant�and treat them with the respect they deserve. In a historic effort, we will fundamentally transform our long-term care system by establishing a new, historic long-term care program, Long-Term Care America, which will provide eligible seniors a benefit of $90 a day for as long as they need it.
My plan also ensures that older Americans have freedom in retirement through greater choice. We will protect the ability of older Americans to choose the health plan that works best for them by preserving
Medicare Advantage, a private Medicare plan that over 20 million older Americans selected for this year; eliminate roadblocks to aging in place so seniors can age at home or in their community if they prefer; and institute a Public Option 401(k) so that all workers have the opportunity to save for and achieve financial security in retirement
In America today, it is harder and harder not just to get ahead, but to hold on to what we�ve got. The stock market may be up, but millions of Americans see their paychecks stay flat even as the cost of health care, housing, and college are rising.1 For too many workers, one job is not enough. Working and middle class families simply can�t keep up.
In my mom and dad�s generation, nine out of every ten kids did better than their parents. But for Americans of my generation, the odds are no better than a coin flip.2 Working family incomes have stagnated almost my entire life.3 Meanwhile, most of our economic growth goes to a smaller and smaller slice of the wealthiest Americans�a dangerous level of inequality that not only threatens our economic security but tears at the very fabric of our democracy and our society.4
We need an economy that delivers more. Families across the country need to see higher incomes, lower costs, and a brighter future for our children. In the United States of America, economic gains should be shared by everyone and everyone should have a fair shot at real opportunity.
The status quo with companies like Facebook and Uber setting the rules and government sitting on the sidelines must change. Our government can, and should, play a role in setting a level playing field that gives all Americans a chance to succeed. That doesn�t mean government taking over the economy. But government does need to be a vigorous presence in ensuring that our economy actually works for all. That means strict enforcement of new and existing labor laws to rebalance power toward workers and ensurethat new industries and technologies fuel growth, not more inequality. That means public investments that lead to thriving workers, children, and families. And that means providing Americans with low-cost, high-quality public options in health and education that spurs competition and drives the private sector to improve.
As president, I will measure success not just by the size of the stock market or gross domestic product, but by whether working and middle class families are succeeding. I will use publiccenforcement, public investments, and public options to make the economy deliver for all Americans, not just those at the top
The American people are facing one of the greatest tests in our history. Climate catastrophe is on the horizon, and history will judge us for how we rose to meet this challenge in our time. We have seen this problem evolve from a theory to a prediction to a reality to, now, an emergency. It affects Americans today, impacting not only our coasts but also farmers, small businesses, homes, and communities across our country.
Communities from Pacific Junction, Iowa to Conway, South Carolina are feeling the effects of extreme weather and changing rainfall patterns. In South Bend, I have had to order the activation of the emergency operations center for 1,000-year and 500-year floods that came less than two years apart. As temperatures and sea levels rise, so does the cost of food and flood insurance. New health issues from heat, air pollution, and the spread of infectious diseases are growing. From hurricanes devastating Puerto Rico to fires ravaging the Amazon, climate change is affecting everyone, everywhere. It is the security challenge of our time, and a wall on our southern border won�t help.
We�re running out of time. Experts tell us that we have 10 years to get on the right path, or global warming will reach catastrophic levels by 2050. For too long, Washington has chosen denial and obstruction. But the timeline that compels us to act isn�t set by Congress�it�s being dictated by science. We must channel all of our energies into a national project�one that unifies every
American, from big cities to rural communities, around this urgent threat and seizes the tremendous opportunity of a new era of climate action. As big as this crisis is, our ideas and aspirations are big enough to meet it. When I am President, we will.
Implementing this vision means tapping into the patriotism of every American and every sector of our economy. It means unleashing the power not only of the federal government, but also of cities, towns, and communities. It means tapping into the potential of rural communities to become part of the solution. It means helping industries that have provided so many families a livelihood to transform into clean energy leaders and be ready to provide for generations to come.
My goal is to make our society a net-zero emissions one no later than 2050, working aggressively toward immediate targets to be met in the years ahead. We will build a resilient nation that can standup to the extreme weather and sea level rise we are already facing, and lead the world in bringing our international partners and local leaders together to solve this crisis. When we tell our children and grandchildren about what we did in this moment, we must tell them that we worked together, took bold action, and met the greatest challenge of our time�for ourselves and for them.
My plan has three pillars:
Build a Clean Economy. The U.S. must invest in talent and enterprise here at home to unlock new technology and bring together partners to reduce emissions across the electricity, transportation, industrial, and agricultural sectors. We must create clean energy jobs, strengthen our rural communities, and protect America�s natural resources. Our intention is to promote a clean and prosperous future for ourselves and our children and to prioritize justice and inclusion as we embrace these changes.
Invest in Resilience. We are already feeling the effects of climate change, whether it�s farmers affected by floods and shorter planting seasons or communities managing storm surges or devastating forest fires. Our plan makes our cities and states more resilient by prioritizing our communities and focusing on infrastructure and disaster preparedness.
Demonstrate Leadership. Combating climate change will require American leadership to bring our nation together and make the fight for a cleaner future a global priority. In doing so, we can also restore America�s badly damaged credibility by leading the world in rising to this challenge while practicing what we preach at home.
Enact a price on carbon and send rebates to Americans. My administration will work with Congress to pass an economy-wide price on carbon, which will automatically increase each year. Revenue will be rebated back to Americans, meaning low- and middle-class households will receive enough to be better off economically than they were before. We will assess a border adjustment tax on any imported goods not subject to a price on carbon where they were produced, which will help protect American industries.
We will also work through international organizations like the United Nations, G20, and World Trade Organization to press other nations to adopt a similar price on carbon.
We will quadruple federal clean energy R&D funding to $25 billion per year by 2025, investing more than $200 billion over 10 years. To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we need new technologies for advanced wind and solar and other new clean electricity, long-duration and seasonal storage, smart grid systems, advanced vehicle technologies, steel and cement manufacturing that can contain captured carbon, and direct air capture of greenhouse gases. The Departments of Energy and Defense invest only $6.1 billion per year in energy R&D., In contrast, China spends approximately $8 billion a year on energy and environmental R&D and is expected to increase spending. In today�s dollars, the Apollo program would cost $117 billion over fourteen years. We need to take this threat seriously and invest accordingly.
The American people have the appetite, creativity, and drive to combat climate change. Their government should support and fund these initiatives. As new industries are built, the entire economy will grow. We will support these efforts with innovative investment funds: American Clean Energy Bank. Building on the success of green banks in states, the American Clean Energy Bank will have $250 billion of initial capitalization. It will provide loans, grants, credit enhancements, and loan guarantees to finance clean energy technologies and energy efficiency, waste and water, and resilient infrastructure projects that create good local jobs, through which the bank can leverage up to six times more private-sector capital. Theseinvestments will target places where private capital is reluctant to go, and will fund innovative startup companies, particularly across the middle of the country. As part of the Walker-Lewis Initiative, this Bank will promote funding for members of under-resourced communities to ensure that they have access to clean energy technology and resilient infrastructure. The Bank will have regional hubs, co-located with our Regional Resilience Hubs, which will provide communities with financing and technical assistance and will ensure all projects funded will abide by critical labor and domestic content standards, notably Davis-Bacon and Buy America.
Global Investment Initiative. Today, the biggest investor in infrastructure around the world is China through its Belt and Road Initiative. If we�re going to fight the climate crisis, we need to ensure all nations are building clean energy and resilient infrastructure, which is why we will launch the Global Investment Initiative to build US developed technologies in developing nations around the world. This $250 billion fund will match with $250 billion in private investment over ten years to partner on clean energy and resilient infrastructure projects that use American technology and are built by American companies. This will harness the investments in American R&D to strengthen our economy and generate jobs at home, while simultaneously combating climate change around the globe.
American Cleantech Fund. This fund will be one of the largest investment funds in the U.S. dedicated to cleantech. It will be capitalized with $50 billion in seed funding to support dozens of demonstration projects of new technologies that are too risky for the private sector, to build first-of-a-kind technology at government facilities, and to ensure these are translated into full scale U.S. manufacturing.
Issue U.S. climate action bonds. We will create Climate Action Bonds to help pay for clean energy and resilience deployment projects. Like World War II-era war bonds, these climate bonds will enable every American to invest in climate action and feel that they own a piece of our future. These Series EE bonds will double in value over 20 years and will go to finance projects in the U.S.
When America was attacked on 9/11, we immediately said that we would never allow it to happen again. We declared that those attacks would change us for the better and we mobilized to action. Today, America is under attack from homegrown white nationalist terror � facilitated by an unchecked corporate gun lobby � and the response from too many of our leaders is still �thoughts and prayers.� After foreign terrorist attacks, airport travelers have to take off their shoes. After three mass shootings in a single week, Congress takes off for recess.
I was a junior in high school when the Columbine shooting took place. This week, as we mark the 7th anniversary of the shooting at the Oak Creek Sikh temple, a mall in El Paso where my grandmother used to take me as a teenager turned into the scene of yet another massacre. For my entire lifetime, after each mass shooting we�ve seen politicians in Washington condemn the loss of life and offer their condolences. They talk about change, but it remains easier to buy weapons of war than a bottle of beer. They condemn the acts of lone individuals, but are too embarrassed or evasive to confront the hateful ideology that spurs so many to act � because an unrestrained gun lobby and racial division serves so many of their political interests. We�ve traumatized an entire generation and are set to traumatize yet another.
Meanwhile, every day, one at a time, we continue to lose an average of 100 lives to gun violence � disproportionately in black and brown communities � all around the country, including in my hometown.
Enough.
Weapons like the one I carried in Afghanistan have no place on our streets or in our schools � least of all in the hands of white nationalists. I want to be able to look back on this moment and tell my children that we brought people together to deliver gun safety. I want my children to be able to go to the mall with their grandmother, or to school, or to the movies, without living in fear.
To meet this urgent national security crisis and secure our communities, the politics of cut-and-paste condemnation and inaction must give way to a new and different approach. One that speaks clearly about the problems we face, and is unafraid to put forth solutions that will actually meet those challenges. One that recognizes we must not only propose smart policy, but also build and sustain political power to ensure those ideas are enacted. One that understands that, yes, the best thing we can do to stop the rise of white nationalism and the pernicious influence of the NRA is to defeat their top enabler in Donald Trump. But we must also act before a new President takes office in 2021.
Policy Action
The United States is the only country in the developed world where this kind of gun violence happens routinely. We throw up our hands as though this was the result of some cosmic force, but these tragedies are the consequence of policy failures. It�s time to address those.
Dedicate $1 billion to prevent and combat radicalization and violent extremism:
The Trump Administration cut funding allocated to the Department of Homeland Security to combat white nationalism. We must do more than simply reinstate that funding � we must dedicate $1 billion to ensure that law enforcement across all agencies and all levels have sufficient resources to counter the growing tide of white nationalist violence.
Empower law enforcement � including the FBI, state and local authorities � with greater resources for preventing domestic terrorist attacks before they occur: More than 70% of international terrorism arrests occur before violence takes place. With domestic terrorism, the opposite is true: 72% of arrests occur after a violent act.
Increase the FBI�s domestic counterterrorism field staff and strengthen ties to state and local authorities, so that our law enforcement agencies can work together to prevent domestic terrorist attacks.
Expand our ability to track hate. We can�t combat what we can�t measure. We must pass the No Hate Act, the Durbin-Schneider Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, and the Domestic Terrorism DATA Act. Restore federal funding for the Global Terrorism Database.
Reinvest in DHS� ability to prevent and fight extremism, violence, and hate. The Trump administration slashed DHS funding and reduced its staff dedicated to countering violent extremism. As an intelligence officer in the United States military who specialized in counterterrorism, I�ve seen firsthand what a concerted, coordinated effort to fight terror can do and what it will take to fully confront this threat.
Pursue domestic white nationalists with international terrorism links. Empower the National Counterterrorism Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to investigate international links to white nationalist violence. The FBI arrests international terrorist suspects through constant vigilance and it should do the same against violent white supremacist groups.
Address the link between gender-based violence and domestic terrorism. Training law enforcement on the connection between misogyny and violent extremism is crucial to prevention, as is funding community outreach and intervention programs focused on sexism.
Stop the spread of violent extremism online:
Work with social media and other online platforms to identify and limit the spread of hateful ideology. Social media companies and online platforms have a critical role to play in ensuring that their services are not used to facilitate and spread hate. Federal funding for tech innovation and training should be used to help improve the software tools that can identify and track far-right extremism, within the boundaries of internet companies� terms of service and consistent with the First Amendment.
Name and shame online platforms and other companies that refuse to take steps to curb use by hate groups. Certain platforms like 8chan exist as an alternative space where right-wing and extremist ideology flourishes. These platforms should be regularly monitored by law enforcement.
Make sure guns don�t get into the wrong hands:
Make background checks universal and close the loopholes that allow dangerous individuals to acquire and keep guns. After each new mass shooting, it has become routine to learn that the perpetrator acquired their guns legally. Current federal law only requires licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks on gun sales, allowing too many people who are banned from having guns to acquire them anyway. This loophole and others that allow dangerous individuals to obtain guns have to be closed.
Institute universal background checks. The Senate should immediately pass universal background check legislation � including from all gun shows and unlicensed online sales � which was passed by the House of Representatives over 150 days ago.
Close the �boyfriend loophole.� We need to close loopholes that will reduce the number of intimate partner homicides, including extending laws to apply to dating partners in the same way that they treat partners who have lived together as spouses.
Close the �Charleston loophole.� Under federal law, if a federally-licensed gun dealer who has initiated a background check has not been notified within three business days that the sale would violate federal or state laws, the sale can go forward by default. We must close this deadly loophole and allow the FBI additional time to investigate potentially dangerous people. Until a background check is completed, gun sales must be prohibited from taking place.
Close the hate loophole. Hate and bigotry have motivated some of the deadliest mass shootings in our nation�s history. In too many cases, a firearm turns bigoted threats into deadly assaults. In recent years, the number of active hate groups in the U.S. has reached an all-time high. We must pass the Disarm Hate Act, which would prohibit people convicted of hate crimes from acquiring or possessing firearms.
Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. In the two decades since Columbine, America has barely changed its national gun laws, besides letting an assault weapons ban expire. As a veteran, I know that military-grade weapons have no place in our neighborhoods. The same is true for high-capacity magazines, some of which can hold up to 100 rounds of ammunition and significantly increase a shooter�s ability to injure and kill large numbers of people quickly without needing to reload. We�ve already decided that certain weaponry � like tanks and rockets � are unacceptable in civilian hands. Congress should similarly reinstitute a federal assault weapons ban and ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
Support red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers. Red flag laws allow a judge to seize legally-owned guns if someone is determined to be an immediate threat to themselves or others. In many cases, people close to a mass shooter had observed clear warning signs of violence � such as stalking or abusing women � but were unable to act to keep the shooter from accessing weapons. Congress should pass a federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act to allow for an intervention before there is carnage.
Establish a nationwide gun licensing system. Comprehensive background checks can be made more effective by also requiring the gun buyer to be licensed � similar to what we require of car owners nationwide. This increases accountability for both sellers and buyers, and makes it less likely that a prohibited individual will be able to obtain a gun. Congress should also supplement universal background check legislation with federal licensing laws.
Resume federal funding for gun violence research. Gun violence is a public health crisis, but for the past two decades Congress has effectively cut funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) for studying gun violence. The House of Representatives allocated $50 million of funding for gun violence research at CDC and NIH, and the Senate should immediately pass it. When someone wants to make it illegal to research something, you�ve got to wonder what they�re worried we might find.
Political Action
Our democracy is broken when 90% of Americans � including most Republicans and gun owners � support a policy like universal background checks, and Congress can completely ignore the will of the American people. Forcing our political system to respond will require dramatic action to build and sustain political power. If you�re sickened by the seemingly endless cycle of bloodshed and bigotry, you don�t even have to wait until the next election. All across the country, there are grassroots advocates mobilizing to pass common-sense gun laws that will keep our communities safe. Take action and become an advocate today.
Call your senators and demand they reconvene immediately to act on gun safety and hate. The House already passed bipartisan legislation in February that would strengthen background checks. But Mitch McConnell won�t even bring the bill to a vote in the Senate. Either this Senate needs to respond to the American people, or this Senate needs to be replaced. Dial 877�615�7198 to call your Senator and demand they take action to prevent gun violence and condemn hate at the highest levels of government.
Build the power of those who won�t accept the status quo anymore. For decades, we�ve been told the NRA is unbeatable. Our leaders � both Democrats and Republicans � have bought into this fallacy. But from the March For Our Lives to statehouses across the country, a new generation of leaders has refused to accept the status quo � and they�re building the political power to make real change. Help build their power by contributing: Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence, Moms Demand Action, Brady: United Against Gun Violence, March for Our Lives, and the Community Justice Reform Coalition.�
End the filibuster as we know it. While we work to take back the Senate, we must also reform it. For too long, Senate Republicans have used the arcane and undemocratic filibuster to thwart the will of the American people. In 2013, in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, bipartisan, common-sense gun safety legislation failed despite receiving 54 votes in the Senate. It�s a pretty basic idea: if the vast majority of Americans support a policy, it shouldn�t require more than a simple majority in the Senate. Call on your senators and Senate candidates to support ending the filibuster as we know it.
Civic Action
Combating hate requires us to build not only policy and political solutions, but cultural and civic ones as well. At the local level, I�ve seen how much more readily we treat our neighbors and coworkers as human beings rather than some category to be demonized. Repairing our social fabric must be part of our approach to taking on this challenge.
Empower local leaders to take action. Use federal grants to empower local leaders � including mayors, law enforcement officials, faith-based organizations, school officials and students, nonprofit leaders and the business community � to find and implement best practices for violence and hate prevention.
Strengthen the social fabric of our nation. The hatred and ignorance manifested in these murderous manifestos is facilitated by a society that has become increasingly alienated from one another. In these times of growing division, it is more important than ever to create shared experiences. And as I found when I deployed to Afghanistan � where I learned to trust with my life people who had nothing in common with me except that we were all Americans � service is a great way to rediscover the bonds that hold us together when others seek to tear us apart. In addition to getting to know your neighbors and participating in local service opportunities, learn more about our call to national service here.
In America, things are impossible until they happen. At the beginning of this decade, it was absurd to imagine that somebody like me could serve openly in the military or be married in my home state of Indiana. But time and time again, from marriage equality to affordable health insurance, we have seen an energized America make incredible breakthroughs. It will require a new way of thinking about our problems and how to meet them, but together we will create change. Join us in making gun safety the issue where the impossible becomes possible.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you and good morning. I'm delighted to be here. Thank you president McRobbie, Dean Feinstein, and your colleagues for hosting us at Indiana University, and I am particularly pleased to be at a school named for two Hoosiers of global consequence, Lee Hamilton and Dick Lugar. Together these two giants used their Indiana values to help shape a tradition
of American leadership, combining responsibility and restraint with idealism and vision. Thank you, Congressman, for your introduction. By his mastery of the relationship between serving a home district and addressing the affairs of the world, Lee Hamilton became one of this nation's most widely respected statesmen, and I'm profoundly appreciative of his encouragement and council over the years. When we first conceived of this speech, we had hoped that Senator
Lugar would also be able to join us, and sadly that was not to be. Like so many who knew him, I am grateful for the time I was privileged to spend in his company. We were from opposite sides of the aisle, but his leadership, from a principled stand against Apartheid to a farsighted focus on nuclear security, was the stuff of true statecraft, and what's not to like
in a onetime mayor from Indiana who cut his teeth as a Rhodes scholar and a Navy intelligence officer? Senator Lugar once mused about the impact of time he spent with his grandchildren, saying, "What's the world going to look like when they're my age?" That really does take, he said, a huge imagination. And it's with that focus on the future and in that spirit of huge imagination that
I'm standing before you. From the beginning, my campaign for President has been driven by the awareness that we face not just another Presidential election, but a transition between one era and another. A fact of which the current presidency is as much a symptom as a cause. I believe that the next three or four years will determine the next 30 or 40 for our country and our world.
And in that context, I'm thankful for this opportunity to share the worldview that shapes my understanding of foreign policy and national security. I do not aspire to deliver a full Buttigieg doctrine today, but I will illustrate how my administration would manage global issues. I want to lay out how I believe American interests and American values can be aligned across American relationships with a view to everyday life
in places like my hometown of South Bend. My central purpose is to argue that the world today needs America more than ever, but only if America can be at her best. As a mayor from the industrial Midwest, as a product of the 9/11 generation, and as a veteran of the Afghanistan conflict, my own worldview is shaped, predictably, by my life experience. When I arrived in college in
the fall of 2000, scholars were debating whether the end of the Cold War amounted to the end of history. The United States appeared to be the unchallenged leader of a global order and the new century was expected by many to be peaceful and democratic. By the time I finished my studies in 2007 America was mired in two wars. Its respect even among our allies had plummeted, and
no one could be certain that the global future would be any better than the past. I was a sophomore when the towers fell, and war came to my generation. I stayed up late debating things like the march toward the Iraq conflict in a student committee room at Harvard's Kennedy School; unaware that in a dorm across the street a few students were in the early stages of coding
a website that would become the engine of the social media revolution. A few years later, I would find myself feeling like I was answering for America, for all her gifts and all her flaws, as a student abroad, an American first in Tunisia and then at Oxford, at a time when the world was growing skeptical about America's leadership and credibility. By the weekend of my 10th college reunion,
I was at Bagram airfield in Afghanistan- the course of my life altered by American foreign policy And through it, I've seen at home in South Bend why foreign policy is not a theoretical discussion for the Americans that I serve. From send off ceremonies for reservists about to be deployed overseas, to union meetings of American auto workers making German-branded cars going to Chinese customers from right in our
own Saint Joseph County, I have seen the local impact of global engagements. The need for a new foreign policy vision could not be more urgent today. Since the election of the current President, the United States hardly has a foreign policy at all. And lest that seemed like a partisan jab, I should acknowledge that for the better part of my lifetime, it has been difficult to identify a
consistent foreign policy in the Democratic Party either. While the current administration lacks a coherent policy, it does show a pattern, a troubling one, when it comes to its conduct abroad. This administration has embraced and emboldened autocrats while alienating democracies and allies around the globe. It has undermined America's alliances, partnerships, and treaties. It has employed tariffs as tantrums, provoked trade wars while disinvesting in the education, healthcare, and
infrastructure fundamental to our nation's long-term strength. It has set It has set defense spending priorities according to the wars of the past rather than deterring wars of the future. And it has been hostile to immigration, costing us people and skills we need while demonizing those who look or pray differently. The pattern is that decisions are made impulsively, erratically, emotionally, and politically, often delivered by means of early
morning tweet, with little regard for strategy and no preparation for their long-term consequences. We need a strategy, not just to deal with individual threats, rivalries and opportunities, but to manage global trends that will define the balance of this half century in which my generation will live the majority of our lives. We see workers struggling and inequality growing amid the uneven impacts of globalization and automation. We see
leaders promise again and again to end the forever wars, only to fall short. We see authoritarianism and crony capitalism on the rise globally while democratic values are in retreat here at home. We see a season of largely unchallenged American power transitioning to a period shaped by the competition of newly rising economies, and all this while our domestic and global institutions become increasingly weakened, paralyzed, and incapable of
meeting the challenges we face. And at the same time, strange as it may seem to speak optimistically about America and the world right now, I have great hope for the possibility that our moment holds. Across less than one human lifetime, more than a billion people have been lifted out of extreme grinding poverty. A global class of young entrepreneurs is emerging from Africa to South Asia, while political
leaders my age or younger are shaping new political agendas as they lead nations from Central America to Europe. With the touch of a finger on a screen, dissidents and democrats across the globe have been connected and empowered and voices once silenced or shunned, voices of women, religious and ethnic minorities, have been lifted to demand their rights and rightful place in society. So faced with this moment of
enormous challenge and great possibility, it is not enough just to say that we won't conduct foreign policy by tweet, nor would it be honest to promise that we can restore an old order that cannot in any case meet the realities of a new moment. Democrats can no more turn the clock back to the 1990s than Republicans can return us to the 1950s. And we should not try.
Now, much was already broken when this president arrived, and he immediately set about smashing whatever remained. Paradoxically, this opens a unique window in which to grapple with the world as it is in the 21st century with greater urgency, and in some ways greater freedom, than before. I often speak of the need for our politics and policies to contemplate the year 2054, the year in which I
hope to retire after reaching the current age of the current president. Thinking about the world three to four decades from now is exactly how we need to compete with countries like China, because that is how they are planning, thinking, and investing. Now to think this far out in American policy, we have to move beyond the news of the day to our deep core principles. To cope with
enormous change, American foreign policy for the future must be securely valued in American values, American interests, and American relationships. First and foremost, the greatest strategic advantage for America has always been the fact that our country has stood for values shared by humanity, touching aspirations felt far beyond our borders. However imperfectly, we have represented and defended principles of freedom and democracy that stir human beings wherever they
live, and whenever such principles have been vindicated around the world, American strength has grown. Today we worry about the current administration's abandonment of the American commitment to promoting democratic values. But just a few years ago, it was Democrats who expressed skepticism as a Republican administration undertook a democracy promotion effort, so violent and so misguided that its fallout very nearly made isolationists of my party. To untangle the
consequences of that scrambled period, we must remember that the lesson of the Iraq disaster is not that there is anything wrong with standing for American values, but rather that any action in the name of such values must be strategic, legitimate, and constrained by the premise that we only use force when left with no alternative. This brings me to the concept of the national interest. As any state
does, we advance our own distinct interests, but much depends on the principles we uphold when pursuing them, especially in the case of America. The next president must set a high bar on the use of force, and an exceedingly high bar on doing so unilaterally. When America acts alone, it can only be because core interests are at stake, and because there is no alternative. Notably, this is not
currently true of the situation in Venezuela. It is not currently true of the situation around Iran. It is the difference between the necessary response to 9/11 in Afghanistan and the self-defeating invasion of Iraq. It is, in short, the difference between Normandy and Saigon. Which brings us to the third pillar of a foreign policy American relationships. Our relationships; bilateral relationships, multinational alliances, international institutions; are the space
in which our policy plays out. Each must be strengthened if we wish to promote American values and defend American interests. With this framework in mind, the tasks for the next president are clear. First, we must put an end to endless war and refocus on future threats. Second, we must promote American values by working to reverse the rise of authoritarianism abroad. Third, we must treat climate change as
the existential security challenge that it is. Fourth, we must update the institutions through which we engage the world to address these 21st century challenges and opportunities. And fifth, we must do all this while involving citizens across America in a meaningful conversation about how foreign policy and national security concern their communities and do more to include their voices and values in formulating our policies. Not only must America
do this in order to prosper, but the world also needs America to do these things. The world needs an America free from entrapment in endless war and prepared to focus on future threats. After 9/11, Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed into law, an authorization for the use of military force to eliminate the threat posed by al Qaeda and to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan. That
law was barely two pages long, yet it has been used for two decades to wage wars and launch military strikes from the mountains of the Hindu Kush to the African Sahel. In mobilizing to meet the extremist threat, we did achieve a measure of military victory, but as the mission drifted, the collateral damage to our national moral authority was enormous, and we far too often bargained against our
own values. Congress abdicated its responsibility on issues of war and peace. We spent $4 trillion and lost thousands of American lives, to say nothing of countless civilians caught in the crossfire. I fear that someday soon we may receive news of the first US casualty of the 9/11 wars who was born after 9/11. As someone who deployed to that war on the orders of a president, someone who
believed back in 2014 that our involvement in Afghanistan was coming to an end, and that I was one of the last to turn out the lights, the time has come for Congress to repeal and replace that blank check on the use of force and ensure robust debate on future operations. We should never again send troops into conflict without a clear definition of their mission and an understanding
of what will come after. We should never again find ourselves in a situation like we did in 2017, when four US soldiers were killed on a counter terrorism mission in Niger, only to have Senators from both parties admit that they didn't even realize that we had a thousand troops stationed in that country. Correcting this is not only a matter of Presidential restraint, but of renewed congressional oversight.
The time for a congress asleep at the switch must come to an end. If members of our military can find the courage to deploy to a war zone, then members of our Congress ought to be able to summon the courage to take tough votes on war and peace. Now, our military capabilities exist, of course, for a reason. We stand ready to use force under specific, lawful circumstances,
and when there is no peaceful alternative. I believe we should use force when there is a clear and present threat to the US, when it is necessary to deter and defend against an attack on or imminent threat against the United States, our citizens at home or abroad, or our treaty allies, and when we act as part of a legitimate international coalition to prevent genocide or other atrocities.
But when we must use force, we must also have an end game. Before, during, and after a deployment of troops, we should also deploy diplomatic, development, and security assistance to guard against future instability. It is not enough to define what we would not do or how we would not get dragged in. After all, war itself represents a kind of failure and true success lies in preventing conflict.
This is why we must anticipate and prevent threats around the world in a clearheaded and forward-looking way. Among the threats to American and human security, nuclear destruction remains paramount. This is why preventing the spread of nuclear weapons should remain a core tenet of our global leadership. For this reason, I will rejoin our international partners and recommit the United States to the Iran nuclear deal. Whatever its imperfections,
this was perhaps as close to a true art of the deal as it gets. As even this administration repeatedly certified, it was preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. It has helped constrain the military threat that Iran poses to Israel and Europe without leading us down a path to another Middle Eastern war. This agreement was concluded not to do Iran a favor, but because it is in our
national security interest, just as a parallel policy of confronting Iran support for terrorism and abysmal human rights record reflects our values and security interests. Now, recommitting to diplomacy with Iran will similarly strengthen our hand in North Korea. For decades, the United States and our allies have successfully deterred North Korean use of nuclear weapons. At the same time, it is also in the interest of regional security to
advance peace on the Korean Peninsula, so rather than a zero sum insistence on full and complete denuclearization before any peace is possible, we can recognize that these two processes can be mutually reinforcing, with small steps leading to bigger ones. You will not see me exchanging love letters on White House letterhead with a brutal dictator who starves and murders his own people. But you will see my administration
work to create the conditions that would make it possible to welcome North Korea into the international community. But until we can change the present dynamic, until there are good faith and verifiable reversals in North Korea's nuclear program, sanctions must remain in place. Now beyond state-sponsored nuclear proliferation, we also face the continued threat of stateless terrorism and extremism at home and abroad. The United States can't fix every
fragile state where extremism might flourish, but with proper legal authorities, we should maintain limited, focused, and specialized counterterrorism and intelligence missions in places like Afghanistan to reduce the likelihood that such places will become launching pads for attacks on the United States or our allies. We must also be proactive and confronting armed extremist threats at home. In my navy counterterrorism training, I learned about the ways in which
terrorists' top priority is to become your top priority. So as a nation, we have to decide, as we go about our daily lives, what level of risk is acceptable? When it comes to our privacy versus our security, what trade-offs are we willing to accept? We must be vigilant in protecting our lives from threats posed by terrorists. We must be no less vigilant in protecting our liberties from
the threat of being undone by our own hand in times of widespread fear. And achieving such balance will be particularly important when we contemplate the possibility of a major security event between now and the next election. Knowing that in the past decade more Americans have been killed in America by right wing extremists than by those inspired by al Qaeda or Isis, we need to acknowledge this threat
too and redirect appropriate resources to combat right-wing extremism and violent white nationalism. The world needs an America ready to reverse the rise of authoritarianism while revitalizing democracy at home and advancing it among our allies. Countries with models that fly in the face of our values, from Chinese techno-authoritarianism, to Russian oligarchic capitalism, to anti-modern theocratic regimes in the Middle East, all present a major challenge to us, and
it is no accident that their hostility to shared values comes as they also present a greater threat to our interests. Ironically, at the very moment when American prestige and respect is collapsing, it has never been more needed that America live up to the values we profess. The world needs the best of America right now. Now, our approach to each region in the world should be guided by
an understanding of our interests that is true to our values. Take the case of Russia, which we should view not as a real estate opportunity, but as a self-interested, disruptive, and adversarial actor. As the most unequal economy of any major power, Russia represents a striking example of what happens when a country attempts to set up capitalism without democracy. And the forces unleashed there; nationalism, xenophobia, homophobia, and
repression of the press; are both highly disturbing in that country and disturbingly ascendant in our own country. Meanwhile, Russia throws its weight around abroad, most egregiously, of course, their unacceptable interference in our elections, which weakened America, both by helping to elect an unstable administration and by eroding confidence in our democracy itself. We must be ready to deter such behavior in the future through diplomatic, economic, and even
cyber tools and information operations. But we must also deal with the real weaknesses that the Russians exploited. Not just the gaps in our technology, but our capacity to be too easily turned against each other. In this sense, domestic problems from racism to social isolation have revealed themselves to be national security vulnerabilities. We've also seen regionally destabilizing Russian behavior, from activities on the Crimean peninsula and in eastern
Ukraine to conduct with regard to intermediate-range missiles. Future policy toward Russia must include a regional security framework that promotes stability for Eastern Europe and incentivizes Russia to adhere to international norms. And central to this will be our partnerships, sadly fractured and endangered by this administration, but ready to be renewed and reinvigorated. 70 years after the founding of NATO, we must repair the strained relationships with our European
allies, not because we owe them or they owe us, but because America is more effective when we work with strong and able partners and when those partners can trust America's word. In Latin America too, universal values that we support as Americans are at stake. Casual references to throwing US troops at situations like the crisis in Venezuela will not help, but engagement will. That means adding, not subtracting,
to USAID efforts in Central America so that we can better address the crime, corruption, and poverty that contributes to mass migration in the first place. And it means working closely with Mexico, one of our largest trading partners, knowing how much we have to gain when Mexico is more prosperous and stable. And yes, it means isolating dictatorship and encouraging democracy, working in concert with our Latin American neighbors.
On the African continent, the winds of change are sweeping aside old regimes and certitudes. In Algeria, a new generation has risen up against the sclerotic government. In Sudan, women have led a revolt against a criminal one, and in Ethiopia we have seen what it looks like when hope triumphs over hostility. By 2025, nearly one fifth of the world's population will live in the nations of a rising
Africa, 60% of whose people are now under the age of 25. That continent now boasts some of the fastest growing economies in the world, which have lifted millions out of poverty and into the global marketplace. And as African peoples demand greater accountability and transparency from their leaders, the United States must stand ready to put our values into action to promote empowerment alongside economic engagement. From the Arctic
to South Asia, American interests will be better served when American behavior aligns with values and norms shared across humanity. And as we mark the 30-year anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, the challenge of China presents perhaps the most pressing example anywhere of the need to stand for American values amid the rise of a potent alternative. The Chinese alternative is the international expansion of authoritarian capitalism. As we speak,
the Chinese government is developing a repressive digital surveillance state in Xingjiang, up to 1 million Muslim leaders are being interned in so-called reeducation camps, and China is investing more than a trillion dollars in its belt and road initiative, expanding its political and economic influence by building infrastructure throughout the Pacific, Europe, Africa, and the Americas as they happily fill the vacuum left by American withdrawal. Of course we
can cooperate with the Chinese on areas of mutual interest from climate disruption, to combating terrorism, to international peacekeeping operations, but we also must be prepared to defend our values, interests, and relationships. We will not be able to meet this challenge by sticking to a 20th century strategy, nor will it suffice to reduce the China relationship to a tit-for-tat trade fight, as if all that matters is the
export/import balance on dishwashers. Meeting the challenge of China means we must maintain investments in the military that can deter aggression and adventurism. As with Russia, we also need to invest in strategies to deal with less overt threats; political interference, proxy wars, cyber attacks, and the potential weaponization of economic and technological interdependence. But beyond that, the new China challenge provides us with an opportunity to come together across
the political divide. At least half the battle is at home, enhancing our domestic competitiveness and stability. The idea that the American way is superior will be difficult to authenticate as long as our federal government is liable to shut down over policy disagreements, as long as Congress can't deliver even on items of consensus among the American people. We will not be very convincing if the world sees China
invest more in infrastructure abroad than we are prepared to invest here at home. We cannot compete for the global economic future if we continue to disinvest in education, infrastructure, health, and technology. If gross inequality and declining social mobility persist in our country, our economic political system will become less and less respected on the world stage, which is why perhaps the single best thing we can do
to rollback authoritarianism abroad is to model the strength of inclusive democratic capitalism right here in the United States. Strength is more than military power. It's our power of inspiration. At key moments, the world has envied not just our strength, but our prosperity, not just our prosperity, but our liberty. If we lose that, we lose what makes America exceptional, and I fear we are losing it quickly. It's
hard to condemn crackdowns on a free press when our president calls our own news media the enemy of the people. It is hard to stand up for human rights abroad when we're turning away asylum seekers at our own borders. It is hard to promote accountability and the rule of law when foreign governments can curry favor as cheaply as the bill for a few nights stay at the
president's hotels and golf courses. Our legitimacy abroad rests on our democracy at home, so let's improve and revitalize our democracy with ambitious structural reforms. Let's get money out of politics, let's depoliticize our Supreme Court, and yes, when we're choosing the leader of our nation, let's join the ranks of democratic peoples around the world who select their heads of government by counting up all the votes and choosing
the person who got the most. Above all, let's lead with our values right here at home. President Eisenhower was right to say, "Whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America." We don't need a wall from sea to shining sea. What we need is to manage immigration and our border humanely, securely, and effectively. And at a
time when authoritarians see women's empowerment as inherently threatening and LGBTQ equality as a nonstarter, we will leave them behind by embracing the diversity of our stories as a strength. And when synagogues and mosques have been viciously attacked, let us aspire to the example of New Zealand's 38-year-old Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. Let us emulate the way in which she reacted to the horrific slaughter, not with walls, but
with words of welcome and decisive action. We model these values at home in order to be convincing around the world. We must also ensure that our relationships around the world reinforce the values that anchor us here at home. That means upholding our values when dealing not just with our adversaries, but with our allies. The Middle East is one of the most important examples of a place where
we can and must uphold our values while advancing our interests. We will remain open to working with a regime like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the American people, but we can no longer sell out our deepest values for the sake of fossil fuel access and lucrative business deals. If we recognize that the torture and execution of dissidents is wrong, then we should have
the courage to say that it is wrong on both sides of the Gulf. The closer an ally, the more important it is that we speak truth to them. The security and survival of the democratic state of Israel has been and continues to be an essential tenet of us foreign policy and is very much in our national interest, which is why neither American nor Israeli leaders should play
personal politics with the security of Israel and its neighbors. Just as an American patriot may oppose the policies of the American president, a supporter of Israel may also oppose the policies of the Israeli right wing government. Especially when we see increasingly disturbing signs that the Netanyahu government is turning away from peace. The suffering of the Palestinian people, especially the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, has many authors, from
the extremism of Hamas and the inefficacy of the Palestinian Authority, to the indifference of the international community, and yes, the policies of the current Israeli government. And now Gaza has become a breeding ground for the kind of extremism that only exacerbates threats to Israel and the region. Israeli and Palestinian citizens should be able to enjoy the freedom to go about their daily lives without fear and to
work to achieve economic well-being for their families. As Israel's most powerful and most reliable ally, the United States has the opportunity to shape a more constructive path with the tough and honest guidance that friendship and fairness require. The current state of affairs cannot endure. The pressure of history and the mathematics of demography mean that well before 2054, Israelis and Palestinians will have come to see either peace
or catastrophe. A two-state solution that achieves legitimate Palestinian aspirations and meets Isreal's security needs remains the only viable way forward, and it will be our policy to support such a solution actively. And if Prime Minister Netanyahu makes good on his threat to annex West Bank settlements, he should know that a President Buttigieg would take steps to ensure that American taxpayers won't help foot the bill. At home
and abroad, it is not too late for America to restore her leadership position as a beacon of values that are both universal and at the core of the American democracy, freedom, shared security. The world does need America to model our values, and the world needs America to prioritize climate security. As a mayor who has had to activate my city's emergency operations center for floods that were
supposed to come less than once in a lifetime and done so twice in two years, I have seen the homeland implications of this threat. We've seen warnings from a generation ago realized today in floods in Indiana, tornadoes in Alabama, hurricanes in Puerto Rico, and the fires in California. And despite what we hear from this administration and from far too many Republicans in positions of responsibility, climate disruption
is here. It is no longer a distant or theoretical issue, it is a clear and present threat. And as traditionally conservative sectors, from the business community led by the insurance industry to our own military leaders, repeatedly remind us, climate instability is a threat multiplier. It can accelerate the spread of pandemics, food insecurity, and mass migration. Research even shows a significant link between temperature rise and the frequency
of conflict. The balance of my lifetime will play out in an era of climate-driven international instability. In other venues, I've had more to say about how America can rise to this national challenge. It's an approach that should include a carbon tax and dividend to reorient our economy around a more sensible reward system. It includes quadrupling American R and D to at least $25 billion a year. Leading
the way on research into renewable energy, energy storage, and carbon storage. I believe it also means we should empower rural America to be part of the solution, helping to unlock the potential of soil management and other 21st century farming techniques. And we could offer a new kind of support for cities and towns seeking to reduce their dependence on carbon. But today I want to emphasize the potential
of climate diplomacy and the kind of world we might build when climate stands alongside democracy and human rights as a central goal and a source of legitimacy for nations in global affairs. Rejoining Paris is just the beginning. As one of over 400 mayors who committed to upholding the Paris goals, and having seen how cities are rising to meet this challenge, even as our respective national governments lag
behind, I believe that the US should foster not only international, but sub-national engagement to meet a challenge whose solutions could be as unifying as its threats are universal. We would do well to host a Pittsburgh summit of cities to form commitments that will stand alongside the Paris framework among countries. Building a robust global framework for climate diplomacy is the right thing to do. It also benefits American
interests, not only because we all stand to lose from climate disruption, but also because countries that share our values tend to be countries with a better track record on climate. It's hard to believe that it would be a coincidence that extraction economies and polluting societies are so often those with a tendency toward authoritarianism. If we promote democracy, we will also be promoting climate action and vice versa.
And by taking seriously the threat of climate disruption, we might go a long way toward improving a climate of global cooperation. So yes, the world needs America to lead on climate. And fourth, the world needs America to update the institutions through which we engage with the world, ensuring that they reflect the fact that our world is closer to 2054 than it is to 1945. To shape this
young century to our advantage, we must renew our national security architecture. Our military certainly, but also our intelligence, communications, diplomatic and development institutions. It begins with taking a hard look at defense. The US has long sought to maintain total dominance in conventional war, but in the coming decades, we are more likely than ever to face insurgencies, asymmetric attacks and high-tech strikes with cyber weapons or drones. Yet
our latest defense budget calls for spending more on three Virginia class submarines, $10.2 billion, than on cyber defenses. It proposes spending more on a single frigate than on artificial intelligence and machine learning. To adequately prepare for our evolving security challenges, we need to look not only at how much we're spending on our military, but what we're prioritizing. And chief among those priorities must be the sacred obligation
we have to take care of the men and women who fight our wars. Half our veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have applied for long-term disability benefits. We owe our veterans the best healthcare through a strong and modern VA, which demands a significant investment to expand the quality and quantity of mental health treatment available. But caring for veterans also means helping them and their families
return to the normalcy they seek. And that is not just a government responsibility, it's something all of us can do. Human connection is the most underrated and important component of community reintegration. I am proud that in South Bend, we piloted an initiative to do more than say "thank you for your service," to do more than offer just another website. Where I live, veterans and their families are
not viewed as a problem to be solved, but as talent to be competed for. They are engineers, little league coaches, elected officials, and I want to enlist our communities to help them give of their extraordinary abilities. Beyond taking a smarter approach to our defense and our care for veterans, we must also rethink our intelligence and communications. We owe our intelligence community a deep debt of gratitude for
the manner in which they stepped up and safeguarded our security in the years since 9/11. But for too long, they have focused on too few threats. In a world where data and disinformation dominate, we should revitalize our intelligence services with an investment in new people and a renewed commitment to tools like human intelligence and next-generation information operations. The same goes for spreading the right kinds of information.
It's not enough to combat falsehoods, we must also disseminate truth. The nation that helped solidarity rise in Poland to begin the downfall of communism in Europe has let the tools with which we once spread our message become weak and siloed. It's time we took an integrated and innovative approach, bridging public and private sectors. International communications must not be a neglected subset of our global engagement, it is
a key to helping the world understand who we are and what we stand for. Ultimately our national security and foreign affairs strategy will only be as robust and sophisticated as the people we recruit to carry it out. The world is not standing still. To successfully navigate these dynamics and seize new opportunities will require a new generation of fluent in different languages and cultures, comfortable in a
digital world, deeply committed to the American project. A foreign policy that serves our people in their daily lives can best be made by government officials who represent the full diversity of our people. For far too long, our national security establishment has not reflected this diversity, so we must work to upgrade our hiring practices to promote diversity and excellence, and no matter where they come from, our finest
minds should find it as attractive and compelling to serve in Foggy Bottom or USAID or Langley as it is to work on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley. We should establish flexible career paths for civilians working in defense, diplomacy, and intelligence with benefits appropriate for a generation that will change professions more often than my parents' generation changed job titles. For those who choose this path, it will
not always be easy. Much of this work happens in the most dangerous parts of the world, and our foreign service officers and development officials and our intelligence community must know that Congress and their President have their backs, are committed to their mission, understand and have prepared for the risks, and will not abandon them or their mission nor scapegoat them in congressional investigations at the first sign of
trouble and will absolutely not use them as political props or pawns. The world needs America to cultivate a diverse and talented generation of personnel ready to engage globally. And finally, the world needs America to be in touch with our own communities. A foreign policy for 2054 must be grounded in the everyday lives of communities across the United States. One thing I've learned on the job in South
Bend is that all politics is not just local, but personal, for someone, and global politics is no exception. Yet the discussion in the media, in the academy and in official Washington seems to proceed sometimes as if foreign policy were far off in its impact and meaning. One former official recently acknowledged, "When the national security seems team sat around the situation room table, we rarely posed the question,
'What will this mean for the middle class?'" In my White House, we will, because our purposes abroad are rooted in our aspirations at home. Our innovators are empowered to compete in the global marketplace only if our leaders are relentless in ensuring that intellectual property is protected. Our workers are empowered to secure their fair share of global economic growth only if workers abroad cannot be stripped of labor
rights and forced to produce at unfair wages that undercut American workers. Our Muslim friends and neighbors are empowered to work and live and contribute to our communities only if their government honors their faith. Decisions made in the White House situation room do reverberate throughout America's living rooms, and every decision concerning the South China Sea should be made through the prism of what it means for a place
like South Bend. In a globalized century, no city, no community is an island. When a manufacturer announces that this trade war with China could potentially cost the company hundreds of millions this year, that matters to the folks who work at their facility on the west side of South Bend. Globalization is not going away, so we must insist on policies that ensure that working families in cities like
mine can play a more appealing role in the story of globalization than the role of victim. And we do that by reaffirming our longstanding international tradition, by tapping the cultural richness of our immigrant families, and by harnessing the potential of global markets. We do it by unleashing the full power of the most global institutions on our local soil, colleges and universities like this one, which teaches more
languages than any other school in America, training the next generation of global leaders. And we do it by ensuring that our local leaders, our state and local experts, and yes, our mayors, are not bystanders in that dialogue. Whether the issue is climate change or trade or immigration, local leaders should be at the table from the beginning, empowered to speak with our national diplomatic, commercial, and military leaders.
To thrive in the coming decades, we must bring the foreign policy conversation out of Washington into the rest of the country and bring the rest of the country into the Washington foreign policy conversation. When I was deployed, living the famous military rhythm of hurry up and wait, I spent much more time reading and reflecting than I usually do at home. I thought about how wars start, how
they end, and how sometimes they don't. I thought about the Australian soldier sitting next to me in the Chow Hall at Bagram, even though nobody attacked his country on 9/11, because that's what partners and allies do. I thought about the diplomats and development workers, painstakingly brokering ceasefires and stabilizing war-torn regions. The trade representative somewhere in Geneva whose work would determine whether someone's job at the tool and
dye factory in Saint Joe County goes overseas, or whether a community like ours would be able to attract foreign investment. And after a long day split between processing intelligence at my desk in a modified shipping container and driving my commander across the hauntingly beautiful and violent city of Kabul, I'd carry a laptop up to the roof at midnight, pick up a wifi signal and Skype into a
city staff meeting back home in South Bend. That tenuous digital link was a reminder that the counter-narcotics efforts in my threat finance cell ultimately mattered to a community on the banks of the Saint Joseph River. That there was a relationship between the city streets I was navigating in an armored SUV in Afghanistan and the ones I was responsible for paving in South Bend. The world needs America,
but not just any America. Not an America that has reduced itself to just one more player scrapping its way through an amoral worldwide scrum for narrow advantage. It has to be America at our best, the America that possessed the forward-looking vision to do things like confront Nazi-ism and rebuild Europe, and even invent the Internet inside the research arm of our Defense Department. It has to be an
America that knows how to make better the everyday life of its citizens and of people around the world, knowing how much one has to do with the other. To do so is to keep our nation safe. It is to master change rather than be made small and fearful by it. It is to see vindicated the values that make our nation what it is and it is to
deserve to be described in terms like greatness. None of us will live to see the end of history. Rather, in our lifetimes, the choices of the generations now living may well fashion more than our share of history. Much will depend on our fidelity to our own values, and we will not have to wait until 2054 to feel the judgment of history on this season, this set of
moments, on which the trajectory of the American project and so much of the future of the modern world will depend. The world needs America to be the best it's ever been. And now it falls to us to set the bearing of our nation. Let us choose well. Thank you. It's an honor to be with you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Hello, Sioux City.
Thanks for giving me the warm � and I do mean warm � welcome. Makes me feel right at home. And thanks so much to North High School for
hosting us. A big thank you to JD Scholton. I'm not sure what his plans are, but I know
that Washington could use a few more people like him. Just putting that out there. Thanks to Dr. Joshua Merchant, President of
Buena Vista University.
Thank you to Kristie for your introduction
and for your work with Big Brothers Big Sisters. Mentoring works. It is one of the best things you can do to
make your community better. We set up for � one of the first things
we did in South Bend was set out to double the number of mentors that we had in our community. It makes a huge difference and it lasts a
lifetime, so thanks for what you've done to build up that organization and those service
opportunities.
So, my name is Pete Buttigieg. Around South Bend most people just call me
Mayor Pete. I'm running for President. And I want to tell you �
I want to tell you a little bit about
what I believe, why I think we need something
completely different, and what that has to
do with service on the eve of the Forth of July. Part of why I�m running is because of the
seriousness of the moment we�re living in. I think even now it�s possible that we are
underreacting. Because what�s happening right now is more
than just a single presidency. It is the beginning of a new era. And it has not yet been decided whether that
era will be enlightened or whether it will be ugly. That�s going to be up to us. And I think at a moment like that it calls
for a different kind of leadership. It calls for different kind of message. And I'm here to make a case that there is
no going back.
It�s something I learned in my own home
town, an industrial midwestern city, that found a way to a different future and stands
as living proof that there is no such thing as an honest politics built around the word
�again.� You just got to look forward. That�s South Bend�s story. And I think we've got to remember that looking
at 2020 because I think it's probably fair to say most of us here are Democrats.
But I travel to some places where people have trouble believing that Trump voters exist. And I think those of us who may be Democrats
or Democrat-leaning independents or Republicans of conscience �
You know, we don't support this President,
but we know people who do.
Trump voters are not an exotic species, right? In our part of the country, there are people
we talk to all the time. They get that look in their eyes. And you realize they're going to vote that
way. And the reason it�s so important to think
about that is that this President could win again. He is deservedly unpopular, but he could win
again. And I think he wins again if we look like
we�re offering more of the same. I think the way he wins again is if we look
like we�re the defenders of a system that hasn�t worked. And what that means is, surprisingly, the
riskiest thing we could do is try so hard to play it safe that we continue to walk down
an establishment path that has Americans believing
that we�re not speaking to them. It's why we�ve got to do something different. A President like the one we�ve got now does
not get within cheating distance of the Oval Office unless something is wrong in our economy
and in our politics. We�ve got to demonstrate that we get that,
and we�re going to answer those changes that are accelerating in our time. Make sure they work for us instead of the
other way around. We�ve got to make life more secure in this
country because countries are like people. We are at our worst when we are insecure. So we�ve got to make sure we�re speaking
to those basic needs folks have, and that means coming up with something completely
different. And that�s where I come in.
See, what could be more different from this
President � � than a guy like me? You know, laid back, middle-class, millennial
mayor from the industrial Midwest. It's not traditional, but I think a mayor
offers something unique at a time when we need to get Washington to start looking more
like our best-run cities instead of the other way around. And I think it also makes sense to put forward
somebody who has confronted the challenges facing diverse, low-income, and struggling
communities in the heartland. I also think it�s not the worst idea to
send somebody in who represents a new generation of leadership in our time.
I belong to a generation that is the
most diverse yet in American history and has
a lot on the line in our future. I came home from high school one day and saw
the Columbine shootings on TV, became part of what is now the � the first school-shooting
generation. And the generation that�s going to be dealing
with climate change for the majority of our adult lives. We�re the generation that if nothing changes
would be the first in American history to earn less than our parents. So we�ve got to make sure things change
and things change quick. My goal is that we make decisions in 2020,
2021, 2022, that will set us up well for 2055. That's the year that, God willing, I will
come to the current age of the current President. And I want to be able to look back on where
we are right now and say that these were the years when we changed the channel in American
politics away from that show that's going
on to something completely different. Now, in order to do that �
In order to do that well, we�ve got
to anchor everything we have to say in our deepest values. The more of a crisis we�re in, the more
we�ve got to fall back on the values that motivate us. That�s why, as those signs say, which I
love, freedom, security, and democracy is our answer to those who say Democrats don�t
know how to put our values on a bumper sticker. Sure we do. And those are our values. And don�t let anybody tell you those are
conservative values, they are American values.
But we've got to help people see the
big picture around freedom. That there's more to freedom than just freedom
from a regulation or a tax somewhere. That it's about freedom to. Freedom to live a life of meaning. Freedom to live a life of your choosing. That's why healthcare is freedom because you're
not free if you're afraid to go start a small business because that would mean leaving your
old job and that would mean losing your healthcare. Healthcare is absolutely part of American
freedom. And so, by the way, is reproductive healthcare,
for women who shouldn't be ordered what to do by government.
I think freedom comes by way of organizing, which is why we ought to support organized
labor in lifting living standards for the
American people.
And freedom comes by way of education, which is why the first President � one of
the first things the new President has got to do � one of the first things I will do
� in the Oval Office is appoint a Secretary of Education who believes in public education.
So, don't let them tell you freedom is a conservative value. It's an American value that has progressive
implications, and the same thing is true about security. By the way, do we have any veterans in the
house? AUDIENCE
All right.
Thank you for serving.
I�ve studied a few languages, and I�m
pretty sure I just � one of those languages I learned how to speak a little bit is Marine,
and I heard a little bit of a strong Marine accent from that side of the room. So thanks to everybody who served. And, you know, when you serve, when you go
into a conflict zone with a flag on your shoulder, it�s not a Republican flag or a Democrat
flag. It is an American flag, signifying, among
other things, the idea that you can criticize your own leadership and no one will question
your loyalty to the republic for which it stands.
So on that note, I feel like I got to say something about this parade that's going
on in Washington tomorrow. I love the Fourth of July.
And I�m a Mayor, so of course I love a good
parade. In fact, I�ll be in the Storm Lake parade
tomorrow. I don�t know if anybody else here is going
to that, but I�m excited to see that for myself. But this business of diverting money and military
assets to use them as a kind of prop, to prop up a presidential ego, is not reflecting well
on our country. One of the reasons I joined the military was
to do my small part in order to make sure my country that I live in was not the kind
of place where the fragile ego of a strongman leader made it necessary for him to feel like
he had to roll tanks down the streets of the capitol city.
It�s not a show of strength, it�s a show of insecurity.
Think about this. Think about the strongest, toughest person
that you know. Picture that person. I bet you it�s not the kind of person who
goes around talking about how strong and tough they are. And every time the President has our country
looking like the chest-thumping loudmouth at the end of the bar, it makes us all look
smaller. Our country is bigger than that. I believe in this country, and we�re way
bigger than our President is making us look at a time like this.
So, it�s a good time for our country, and our party, to talk about security in a
new way.
And that means recognizing that twenty-first
century security is going to be a little different. It includes things like cybersecurity and
election security. Security means dealing with violent white
nationalism that has claimed lives in this country and overseas.
It means finding a way to honor the Second Amendment without letting it become
a death sentence for thousands of Americans every year. Which we can do.
And I don't have to lecture a river community in Iowa about how climate disruption
is a security issue in our time.
Now, the good news is most Americans are with us on all of this.
Most Americans agree with us on these issues. There�s just the small matter of making
sure that our democratic republic reflects the will of the American people. And that�s where democracy comes in. Because our democracy is struggling a little
bit right now. It�s struggling because districts are drawn
to where politicians are picking their voters instead of the other way around. It�s struggling because some Americans,
U.S. citizens in D.C. or Puerto Rico, don�t enjoy the same political representation as
the rest of us. It�s struggling at the hands of a Supreme
Court that�s starting to look like a nakedly political body. And we can fix all of that.
I�d argue we might even go so far in a democracy
as to pick our President by just counting up all the votes and giving it to the person
who got the most.
But even with all those reforms, there�s something else we�ve got to do for our democracy,
and that�s why I�m here to talk about service. It�s that faith in our institutions is near
record lows. Six in ten Americans or less express trust
in their fellow Americans. And we have got to knit back the American
fabric, quickly, if we want our democracy to work. When I was overseas in uniform, the biggest
thing I learned was how to put my faith in people who were completely different from
me. The military that I was part of drew on people
from every part of the country.
People with different views, different backgrounds. It was the most racially-integrated organization
I�ve ever been part of. And there were some people there who we basically
had nothing in common except the fact that we were American. But every one of the 119 times I found myself
going outside the wire, driving or guarding a vehicle, I was with people who were trusting
me with their lives and I was doing the same. And they did not care if I was a Democrat
or a Republican. They did not care if I was going home...
Did not care if I was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend. Did not care what country my dad immigrated
from. They just cared that I knew how to do my job.
Because we all wanted to get home safe. And so what's been on my mind is that that
life-changing experience of mine is one that I wish more Americans had, but I don't think
you ought to have to go to war in order to have that experience. The question is, how do we create that kind
of common bond without expecting everybody to be in the military. And there's a way to do that. It's signing up for a cause that's greater
than ourselves. The philosopher William James called it a
way to inflame the civic temper as history has inflamed the military temper. And this is not a new idea, nor is it a partisan
idea. You know, up until now, every administration
believed in service.
President Kennedy launched the Peace Corps
and challenged us to ask not what the country could do for you. George H.W. Bush talked about the Thousand
Points of Light. President Obama expanded AmeriCorps and said
that when you serve today, you connect your own unlikely story to the American story. And by the way, right here in Iowa, Congressman
Dave Loebsack was a huge champion of service, and so was Tom Harkin, among others, on both
sides of the aisle. The only exception I could find, actually,
is the current President, who proposed killing the Corporation for Community and National
Service. Taking a billion dollars out of it in the
budget. That didn�t come to pass, but that�s what
they proposed. And yet at this moment when social media and
polarization are putting us in our own bubbles,
it�s never been more important to find a
common character in our country. And service is a way to do it. It�s a way to do it that offers a tremendous
return on investment. Some studies say you get about four dollars
for every one you put into it. And that�s why I believe we need to create
dramatically more service-year opportunities for Americans as soon as they finish high
school.
Now, I picked Iowa to lay out this proposal because this is a state that punches above
its weight class when it comes to service. Four in ten Iowans report volunteering in
their community. One study found that Iowa was in the top five
in the country for volunteerism. Do we have anybody who has been part of a
volunteer program? AmeriCorps?
Peace Corps? Big Brothers Big Sisters? Something in your community? Raise your hand, be proud. Be recognized.
And I bet you learned a lot about yourself and a lot about your country when you did. So whether it's an AmeriCorps team rebuilding
communities after floods, or the communities that welcomed more than 18,000 refugees resettling
in Iowa, or the work that's going on to help third graders read right here in Sioux City. For Iowans, service is bedrock. Services is in your souls.
And I want to make that a norm all across
America. So today I'm proud to announce a new call
for service with three major steps. One, we propose to immediately triple paid
service opportunities. To bring them to 250,000 opportunities targeted
toward America�s high school graduates, community college, and vocational students. These are paid positions with the added benefit
of job training, hiring preferences, and qualifying for public service loan forgiveness. Second �
Oh yeah, that's pretty good, too.
Second, we recognize that communities are where so much problem solving happens. And so I believe the federal government should
support communities coming up with their own
service opportunities with competitive grants
that go to cities, towns, counties, communities, and regions that want to create a whole ecosystem
of service around whatever issues matter most in your community. That's step two, and that's what our federal
government ought to be ready to do.
And third, I believe by 2026, when we�re going to have a very big Fourth of July because
it�s the 250th birthday of this country, that by then we can invest so that one million
high school graduates have an opportunity for a full year of service to their community
and to their country.
Now, doing that will require resources, it will require organization, and I propose
we set up a Chief Service Officer who will have direct access to my office. And I think when we do that, we will find
not only that a lot of work gets done but
that Americans come closer together. There is scripture that says, whom shall I
send and who will go for us? And Isaiah says, "Here I am, send me." This is for everybody who has said, "Here
I am, send me." And, I know there are a lot of people here
who would take advantage of those opportunities. Ask yourself, would you be part of a Community
Health Corps that would focus on those struggling with addiction, mental health, or substance
use issues?
Sounds like we got some takers.
How about an Intergenerational Corps to provide caregiving to our nation's seniors
and learn from them while you do?
How about a Climate Corps? To be first responders in the wake of the
last disaster and build resilience to help
prevent the next one?
Sounds like we got some takers. There�s a reason why the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps,
the military, they�re all turning away far more people than they can accept. The desire to serve, the hunger to be part
of something bigger than yourself, is already alive and well. We just got to make sure we rise to meet it. So we�re going to try to model that in our
own campaign. We�re going to make a point of meeting with
local service leaders on our campaign stops. And next month we�ll be calling on all of
our supporters in every state to join us in a national day of service to truly make that
part of the ethic of our campaign. I hope you join us.
We�ll know we�ve succeeded when the first question you get for a young person
applying for a job or applying to college is not just "Where are you from?" but "Where did you serve? What was it like? Who did you meet? And what did you learn?" When we do that, when we bring together Americans
from every walk of life, we will be repairing the fabric of our nation.
We can shape a whole new generation of American people bound by mutual service. Aware of common values that bind us as Americans,
not agreeing on everything, but having that
common touchstone that so many veterans have
but that you shouldn�t have to go to war to experience. So tomorrow as we celebrate the birth of American
democracy, I�m looking forward to seeing how it�s done Iowa-style. And I think it�s an opportunity to think
about what really does make us great. Not so much our independence, but our interdependence.
That idea that for all our differences of race and religion and region, politics,
all of our disagreements, out of many, we are one. That�s patriotism. It�s not the size of our military budget,
it�s not the tanks the President wants to roll down a street in Washington, it is what
lives in the hearts of people committed to
a greater cause than themselves.
When a tornado went through Marshalltown, all the Habitat for Humanity volunteers came
from all across the state. One of them said, "This is what Iowans do. We stand up for each other when the chips
are down." It�s what Iowans do, what Americans do,
and seeing that spirit of service, I am optimistic for our future. So, Sioux City, are you ready to answer the
call to serve?
And are you ready to take our deepest values and build them into a different kind
of politics in our time?
Are you ready to mobilize not just to win the next election but to win the next
era in American life?
Then I feel pretty good about our future. Let�s have a conversation. I don�t want to talk at you the whole time. I�m thankful that you�re here. I know it�s a little warm so I appreciate
the endurance that this represents. We�ve got some microphones going around. I�d love to answer any questions, whether
it�s about this or anything else that�s on your mind. Hi. Hello. Hi, Mayor Pete. My name is Rachel, and I'm with the Iowa States
for Service Coalition.
So, thank you for your service and also your
support of AmeriCorps and elevating the conversation about national service. I have a comment and then a few questions
about your national service plan. This year AmeriCorps is a national service
program, it�s celebrating its 25th anniversary, and over a million Americans have already
served as AmeriCorps members. Here in Iowa, we have over 1,400 AmeriCorps
members, over 5,000 Senior Corps volunteers, and 90,000 volunteers serving in the Volunteer
Generation Fund and mentoring programs, like we heard about before, all managed through
Volunteer Iowa, the state commission here. While these numbers re impressive, they are
addressing only a small fraction of the need here in Iowa and engaging a small percentage
of Iowans that could serve. As you know, AmeriCorps is a complex federal
program, and it can be hard for smaller communities, like Sioux City and those more rural communities
surrounding to really access those resources.
How will your plan build off the existing
infrastructure by working with state and local governments, and also, through your plan,
will national service be accessible to all Iowans that want to serve, and how will it
be accessible to all types of Iowa communities? Thank you. Fantastic. First of all, thanks for your advocacy on
this issue. And there�s a lot there. Let me start with what you�re saying about
the local piece because I think this is really important. Different communities have different needs. And they organize themselves in different
ways. And that�s why I think we not only need
to provide the funding to allow more people
to serve in established programs, like Peace
Corps or AmeriCorps. We also ought to recognize that a lot of communities
are going to come up with their own solutions. That�s where the competitive grant program
comes in. So in addition to the federal match that will
go to the kinds of programs we�ve already got. AmeriCorps is a good example. We�re using that in South Bend to help weatherize
homes. It makes it possible for seniors to afford
to live in their homes more, and it makes us more sustainable for climate. But we want to challenge American communities
to devise their own systems for service. And then we will, through that competitive
grant process, support them and circulate the ideas and what they learned from each
other, bring them together from time to time
to share those best practices. I�m also really glad you mentioned the importance
of making it possible for all Iowans, all Americans to contribute. Because this is also something we all need. It�s not only to be supported but to be
given a chance to support others. This is a huge issue for veterans� reintegration. It's why things like Team Rubicon are such
remarkable organizations. They don't go to a veteran and say, you know,
"I'm going to just hand something to you." They say, "I still need your help. America still needs your help even if you're
out of uniform." And that community and identity and purpose
that you build up, that is one of the rewards of service.
We also want the positions to be paid, but
this reward is as meaningful or more in so many cases. And so that will be something that will be
given scoring, given points in the competitive grant system to show that it is an inclusive
program that makes it possible for different people to serve. But it�s also why we�ve got to put some
funding behind this. You know, for far too many, service is kind
of a luxury. And we�ve got to make this a universal norm
which means it has to be available to everybody who wants to serve, no matter their backgrounds,
abilities, or means. Thank you.
Let's see, question on this side? Yep?
Hello. My name is Langston. And so I�m looking forward to later in my
life possibly serving, and you mentioned student loan forgiveness. I'm wondering if you could elaborate a bit
more on that. Yeah, absolutely.
Pretty cool to already be thinking about service at his age, isn't it? Well, first of all, by the time you're applying
for college, I'm hoping it will be dramatically more affordable, and we've got a separate
set of plans on that.
So that a lot of students who today carry debt wouldn�t even have debt coming
out of college.
But for those who would, we want to make sure
that we reward public service with a way to reduce or eliminate your debt based on how
much you've served. Now, there�s a program for that now, it�s
called Public Service Loan Forgiveness. But the way it works, it�s really hard to
actually use the benefits. And so one of the things we want to do with
this service program is make sure that your service here qualifies for that benefit so
that you can use it toward paying down your debt. And, there ought to be hiring preference,
so if you are applying for a job later, and you�ve been in one of these service programs,
you get extra points for that when you�re applying for a job, and that will help you
boost your income, too. So, check me with me once you�re finishing
your service year and we'll see whether we delivered on that, but I�m glad you�re
already thinking about it.
Thank you.
All right. Come back to this side. Right here in front, sir. Mic will come right to you. AUDIENCE Afghanistan. Yes, sir. AUDIENCE When are we getting out? So, when I left in 2014, I thought I
was one of the last troops turning out the lights. I thought it was ending then. Five years later, we�re still there.
And it�s clear that there�s not a very
strong plan on how to get out. We�ve got to go. We�ve got to put an end to endless war.
And that means a mission that is not defined as being the provider of full peace
and prosperity there. We can't be responsible for that. What we should do is, as we leave, try not
to do anything that would undermine the Afghan government. And I am worried that we're talking to the
Taliban, we're not talking to the government that was elected there. But at the end of the day, the Afghans have
to stand on their two feet. Now, one of the things you learn from
going � I mean, this is 2019.
You�re almost old enough to enlist � you
could enlist today and not have been born on 9/11. And the lesson from that is that when you
get into one of these conflicts, it is extremely hard to get out. Which is why the best thing we can do to end
endless war is not to get into one in the first place if it can be avoided, and it�s
why we've got to get off the war path with Iran. AUDIENCE
All right. Right up front. Love the shirt, by the way. So, my name is Helena. I'm a high school student from Nebraska.
Hi. My question is, like, ever since the
Parkland shooting, I�ve been really scared to go to school or really any public place. What is your plan to fix the gun control issue
that we�re having? Well, thanks for raising that. And �
You know, one of the things that's changing
the conversation is people your age looking elected officials dead in the eye and saying,
"What are you going to do to keep us safe?" Because you have a kind of moral authority
that leaves the likes of the NRA in the dust. So keep raising your voice.
Now, the crazy thing about this issue is, there's a lot of stuff Americans agree
on doing right now.
Let's start with universal background checks. Most Americans agree, most Republicans agree,
most gun owners agree. We just can't get most members of Congress
to agree. It's one of the reasons why I think we need
to do things like that redistricting reform, money in politics, and the rest of it. If there's that much daylight between the
American people and the American Congress, something's twisted in our democracy. But �
But the bottom line is, we will fight
� I will fight � for universal background checks. Number one. Number two, we need red flag laws.
So when somebody is a danger to themselves
or others, we make it harder for them to get a weapon. Or, for that matter, ammunition. We�ve got to disarm domestic abusers and
catch mental health issues before they turn lethal. That�s number two.
And number three, having trained on a lot of weapons of war when I was in the
military, I've got to tell you, with all respect for self-defense, and hunting, and the rest
of it, there are weapons of war that simply do not belong in American neighborhoods in
peace time.
But I really think we can deliver that change if we�re ready to see the political
will from the White House and to remind constituents
when their members of Congress are ignoring
them because we�ve gone far too long. Will this prevent every tragedy? Maybe not. But it will save thousands and thousands of
lives. And shame on us if we don�t deliver it. Also, for those who can�t see, I just � I
love the tee. The t-shirt says, "We should all be feminists." And �
At a moment like this, it is especially
important, I think, for men to step up and be feminists, too, so thanks for the reminder.
All right. Let's see.
Make sure we're responding to the back. Uh, right there. Green shirt. AUDIENCE Hello. If elected president, it�s quite likely
that you will be facing a Republican majority in the Senate. How do you plan on working in a bipartisan
way with leader McConnell to appoint Supreme Court justices and get legislation through?
So there's two ways of looking at this. The first is, in that scenario, we've got
to deal with it. I wouldn't get very far as a mayor in Indiana
if I didn't know how to work with Republicans. I'm on my third Republican governor.
We've got a legislature so Republican that
the Democrats don't even have to show up for them to do business. Not needed for a quorum. And so, what I've found works is not to pretend
to be more conservative than I am, but to work consistently with the values that motivate
me. Be very transparent about them. But also, look at areas where there's agreement. And again, some of these areas of agreement
might surprise you. Gun safety is one of them. Among the American people. Just not among the American Congress. By the way, immigration is another one.
You know, most Americans are for a comprehensive
bipartisan reform of the immigration system. It�s Washington that can�t get it done.
So, I think that, look, I think that we have lost a lot of our illusions about
good faith among the Senate Republicans. Did you see where Mitch McConnell said if
there was nominee in 2020, they�d go ahead and vote on it even though in 2016 they said
it was morally wrong to do it in an election year? They�re not even pretending to be working
in good faith anymore, right? And so that brings me to by far the best solution
to the very serious and very real issue that you raised, which is to make sure that there
is not a Republic Senate majority. And that means having a candidate with coattails
and it means winning.
All right.
Dead center with the blue shirt, if we can
get a mic to you. Thanks to our mic runners, by the way. I know we�ve got you moving around a lot. AUDIENCE Thank you. Okay. Hi, Pete, first of all. Hi. AUDIENCE I am from Syracuse, Indiana. Alright. AUDIENCE Beautiful Lake Wawasee. Yeah. AUDIENCE And when you mentioned the
electoral college, I would like you to speak
just a little bit more on that because I have
experienced being a token Democrat in a Republican small town. But also, I�ve experienced living in the
heartland and wanting to make sure that our voice and our vote matters. Now, I live in Nebraska which has a modified
electoral vote. And I am basically just wondering your justification
for comments such as �completely eliminating� versus modifying in a way that may or may
not actually be more representative of people in small rural towns and people in huge cities. Right. So, here's the way I look at it. The electoral college as we have it now doesn't
really lift up small communities or big communities, it just lifts up certain communities.
Right? So, in Indiana, most years our electoral votes
don't matter, so nobody ever talks to us because we're a very conservative state. In Illinois, it's the same thing because they're
reliably Democratic. Small states from Wyoming to Rhode Island
are penalized. Big states from California to Texas are penalized. It's got nothing to do with how big or how
small you are, how rural or how urban you are. It just has to do with whether you happen
to be one of the handful of states that benefits by that math. And I think that if we go by the very simple
principle � I think Nebraska is a step in the right direction, by the way.
It's better than what we've got now. But, at risk of sounding simplistic, I think
the fairest way to deal with this is just to say everybody�s vote and voice counts
exactly the same.
That way somebody's got to care about your vote even if you�re a lonely Democrat
living in a conservative area, or vice versa. Your vote still matters because it counts
toward the total. We�ve got to speak to you wherever you are
in this country. Whatever kind of community you live in, whatever
your life experience. Instead of writing off entire states because
they don�t fit into that math. So that's the way I think of it. That we just go with one person, one vote
and stop trying to put a thumb on the scale here and a thumb on the scale there.
There's more than enough of that in the Senate,
and that makes sure small states get privileged more than kind of the average. But for the rest of it, I just say let's all
count the same.
All right. Make sure we get this side here. Right here. Red shirt. Hi. Hi. My name is Margine Negles. I'm part of SCAN, which means Save the Children
Action Network. A couple of questions I have is on early education.
As a president, what actions would you take
to ensure that all families can afford child care and early education so children are prepared
to enter school and parents can work. Thank you. So two big things that we need. And I was talking to somebody just recently
on the campaign trail who was describing a young working couple. And she did the math. They both work, so her kid's in childcare. And what she realized is the childcare bill
is consuming everything that she earns at work. She's basically working in order to be able
to afford to be working. And that's no way to support working families
in this country.
So, there's two things we've got to do. The first is to support people in being able
to afford childcare. And that's where tax credits that can recognize
when somebody's in that situation and let them decide how best to deploy those dollars
is the right way to go, in my view. The second thing we've got to do is deliver
quality pre-kindergarten childcare for every American. And I think we can do it.
It's not cheap, but there is a huge return on investment. It's one of the best things that can pay for
itself. You know, we were told falsely that a tax
cut for the wealthiest would pay for itself. We've run this experiment lots and lots of
times.
Turns out it just isn't true. It's kind of like what they say about communism. You know, it sounds good in theory, it doesn't
work in practice. That's true of supply side economics too. But, there are investments you can make, expenditures
you can make that pay back. And one of them is investing in early childhood
education. Because you have better outcomes, longer life,
longer earnings. You even see fewer people going to prison
when they�ve had the benefit of early childhood education. And communities won�t be able to do it without
federal support, so there needs to be federal funding to help local communities make that
a reality. All right.
Let's go right here. On the aisle. Thank you for taking my question. My name is Pat Boggs, and I have a healthcare
concern. I am a voice for the Alzheimer�s Association,
a voice for the AIM, and a voice for the 5.8 million Americans who deal with dementia and
their loved ones. My question is, as President, do you have
a plan to help promote caregivers and how to deal with the issue of Alzheimer�s and
other related dementias? Yes. And thank you. Thank you for being a voice.
I don't know, Pat, if this has impacted
� how this has impacted you, but I think
so many of us � is it a parent? Yeah. Okay. Well, thanks for channeling obviously what
is such a cruel disease and making that � making yourself a light to others through that. Not everybody has the strength to do that,
and that's really important. So thank you. And I believe there are two categories of
things we've got to do. One of them is research on this disease. Because I've got to believe that America can
tackle Alzheimer's if we adequately fund research. So CDC, NIH, and other institutions with federal
support, and support into the universities, should see an expansion in the funding that
goes in to dealing with a disease that, as
you said, touches so many. And by the way, costs us so much as a country. The human cost and the cost that we can count
up in dollars and cents. So we�ve got to do that. Now, in order to do that, it's going to be
important to have a White House, as mine will be, that believes in science. That doesn't view it as political stuff. That believes in it.
Now, the other side of the equation that you mentioned is supporting caregivers. And I think this ties into something a little
bit deeper, which is there's a lot of talk about working people, supporting working people,
as we all want to do.
But I think our definition of work is a little
bit narrow. If it's work that you get a W-2 or a 1099
for, we call it work. And we honor it in a certain way. But I think all of us would agree that caregiving
is work. It happens in a home, you don�t get paid
for it, but it�s work.
We�ll be sharing more on this later this summer, but just to give you a preview,
I believe when we provide support through our tax code for working people, we need a
wider imagination about what that actually means. And it should be expanded to include the work
of parents and the work of those who are taking care of parents and loved ones because that�s
work, too, and the federal government should be able to recognize that.
All right. Where'd our mic go? We've got one right behind you on the doorpost
there. Hi, I'm Abby LaFleur. I'm a college student, and I think that one
issue that people my age might think is the biggest is climate change. And so I guess I'm just wondering what specific
legislative action do you plan to take to tackle that issue? Well, thanks, Abby. Several specific things that we know we�ve
got to do. And some of them get talked about a lot and
some of them don�t. Let�s start with the ones that you hear
a lot about, and I just want to get it on
the record that I support them. One of them is we need a carbon price and
dividend. We�ve got to do it in order for our economy
to have the right rewards for us to do the right thing, to capture the true costs of
the choices we make every day. Now, everybody's afraid of that because another
word for carbon price is tax, and you�re not supposed to use the �T� word if you�re
running for office. But, we could rebate out � the point of
the carbon tax is not to take money out of the economy. It�s to make sure that prices reflect the
true cost of things that put a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. And that means that we can put that money
right back into the economy. So I would propose that the carbon tax, or
price, include a dividend that distributes
all of it right back out to the American people. And do it in a progressive way so that most
of us are made more than whole. In that way, it can also help empower a lot
of Americans, and I think it helps some of the political allergies to this very necessary
policy go away. That�s just one thing we�ve got to do. Another thing we�ve got to do is increased
research, with federal backing, on energy storage, carbon storage, and renewable energy. We should probably at least quadruple it to
about $24 billion a year. It�s important enough that we ought to be
doing it, and there are some things that just won�t happen without federal backing to
get that research done. So that�s another one. Now, these are the kinds of things you hear
about a lot.
I think we pretty much agree on that, among
Democrats. A couple things for some reason you don�t
hear about as much. One of them is the importance of the local. So there�s a lot of cities that have come
together frustrated that our � from around the world, not just around America � frustrated
that national governments are not doing enough. And, basically, we realize, you know, between
us we got so many of the world�s population and so much of the world�s economy, that
if we met these goals, we would be halfway there. And so South Bend, even though Washington
got out of the Paris Accord, South Bend said, "We�re still in." We ought to support local community problem
solving for sustainability. And what I would do, in addition to rejoining
the Paris Accords right away, is I would follow
that up with a Pittsburgh summit, right here
on American soil, that brings together communities, and states, and looks at how the federal government
can support them in their actions about sustainability at the local issue �
� local level. Last policy I want to mention is that we�ve
got to invite rural America to be part of the solution. I think right now a lot of folks in rural
America feel like we�re telling them they�re bad because we care about climate change when
actually, if you look at things like soil management, there�s a lot of research that
suggests that the capacity of the world�s soil to hold carbon is as much as the carbon
that gets put into the atmosphere by the entire global transportation sector, if we could
just figure out how to do it. That�s just one example of how through soil
management and other sustainable practices
in rural America, we could be finding a lot
of the solutions there. And I think that�s necessary because this
can�t be an issue that pits one part of America against another. We've all got to gain by dealing with it. And this is no longer an issue that we have
the luxury of debating whether it�s real. If you�re still debating it�s real, we
can�t � we literally don't have time to argue with you. We've seen it in Iowa. We've seen it in Indiana. I have had to activate the emergency operations
center of my city, twice, in two years. The first time was for a thousand-year flood
and the second time was for a 500-year flood. Now, either I'm running some ridiculous odds,
or things are changing around us.
We know this. We've got to adapt. And we've got to act fast to make sure it
doesn't get worse. And much like the issue of gun violence, I've
got to tell you the moral authority of a new generation saying, "Hey, our lives � our
life opportunities are going to depend on whether you folks in power figure this out." Your activism is going to be what makes the
difference between this election and the last election where, shockingly, the number of
climate change questions in the presidential debates was zero. That's not going to happen again, and it's
because of people like you.
All right. Sounds like we've got time for one more, and,
ooh, a lot of hands are up.
Right here in the purple shirt, if you can
get there. Yep. My name is Chris and I'm from Nebraska. It's likely when our unicameral meets again
for the next session that they'll bring a bill similar to Georgia and Alabama for an
abortion ban. And I'm just curious on what your plan is
to make sure Roe v. Wade stays the law and where you stand on appealing the Hyde amendment. Yeah.
First of all, I believe the Hyde Amendment's got to go.
And more broadly, unfortunately, what we�re seeing is they�re tearing up what
amounts to an American agreement.
Obviously, this is a tough issue for a lot
of people. It�s a tough issue where I live. I�m the Mayor of South Bend, Indiana. The Democratic mayor of South Bend. The pro-choice Democratic mayor of South Bend,
Indiana. Right? It�s tough. People I know, people I love, people who support
me, don�t see the issue the way I see it. But the way I see it is that this is one of
the most challenging decisions that a woman can face. And it is challenging if she faces it on her
own. It is challenging but perhaps made better
if she recruits the advice and support of
people in her life, religious guidance, if
that�s how she see�s the world. Medical guidance for sure. But what doesn�t make that decision any
better, medically or morally, is for the government to come in and tell her what she oughta do.
So you can count on me to have that philosophy reflected in my judicial appointments. You can count on me to have that reflected
in my legislative agenda. And you can count on me to continue to believe
that it�s twice as important right now for men to be standing with women and standing
for reproductive rights.
Again, I want to thank you. We�re going to be in Iowa an awful lot over
the coming months. Looking forward to getting to know you.
Hoping to earn your vote. Hoping to earn your support. Hoping that you�ll tell friends about our
message. And the one thing I want to leave you with
is that I still believe this is a season for us to have an awful lot of hope about our
country. I know it�s tough to talk about things like
hope at a moment when we�ve got such bleakness and divisiveness emanating from our capitol,
that show I was talking about, whether you think of it as a horror show, or a reality
show, or a game show, or a couple unrepeatable words also come to mind. But we got � we�re not going to go on
that show. If you�re playing his game, you�re losing. If you�re talking about him, we�re not
talking about you.
So we�re going to change the channel. And �
And I need your help to do it. But, I�m telling you, running for office
is an act of hope. Supporting somebody running for office is
an act of hope. Sweating in a high school gym on a very warm
day is an act of hope, so you give me hope. And I�m so thankful that you find it worthwhile,
that you find it worth being involved, that you know how much this matters. Can I count on you?
Then with you at my side, I think I can�t lose. I can�t wait to see you every step of the
way, and I�ll see you on the trail.
Thank you for your support. Thank you for everything you bring to this. I can�t thank you enough. Thank you.
the cost of higher education in this country is a huge equity issue students and their families who do attend are often burdened with mountains of debt what do you want to do to change this so this one's personal for us as a household we're we got six figures student that to apply our questionnaire here there you are so and I don't need to tell New Hampshire about the consequences of unaffordable College the the worst consequences for the state
itself because so many people find it is cheaper to go out of state somewhere else and it is in-state here and there's a direct relationship between that and the level of spending that the state commits so more and more of the burdens being pushed on to the student and we need on the back end to make sure that there are more ways to relieve student that it's why I think we should massively expand the public service loan forgiveness program make it more general
generous and make it more user friendly so that people can take advantage of that and do away with their debt we got to make more affordable on the front end it should not be impossible for a middle-income family to get to college let alone a low-income family so we can make College free for low and middle income students and for everybody else we can make the debt reasonable enough that is not a barrier to being able to attend how do we do it well
carrot-and-stick with states a state federal partnership we can put some federal funding behind it but we also got to induce states to step up to the plate and Pell grants need to be not only expanded but made eligible to cover living expenses because that's a big part of what's holding people back and this time let's peg it to inflation so we don't have to go back to Congress and ask every time the purchasing power of a Pell Grant falls behind if we take these
steps college can be affordable for the next generation you
we shouldn't have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldn't have been started in the first place I will support farmers but not long ago I was in Boone Iowa guy came up to me he said I got my Trump bailout cheque but I would have rather spent that money on conservation by the way this isn't even making farmers whole if you're in soybeans for example you're getting killed and it's not just what this president's done with the trade war
and a lot of parts of the country the worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers which are killing those who were involved in ethanol look I don't think this president cares one bit about farmers he keeps asking him to take one for the team but more and more I'm talking to people in rural America who see that they're not going to benefit from business as usual under this president I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers
but we have to stand up for them not just with direct subsidies and support but with making sure we do something about the consolidation the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to and American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change I believe that the quest for the carbon- farm could be as big a symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car
in this country and it's an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of this solution including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging their part of the problem
thank you hello South Bend it means so much to be here with all of you today and I want to thank everybody who is part of that program father Brian for your guidance and prayers for not being fazed by divine interventions bishop miller for your spiritual and
civic leadership Janet Hines Norris for that amazing performance I want to thank our fire department honor guard and thank all our first responders for everything you do to keep us safe Thank You Renee Ferguson for your mentorship and your passion for justice and mrs. Chisholm our everyone should have at least one person in their lives who believes in them the way you believed in your students to my fellow mayor's mayor cabal de
mayor Whaley and mayor Adler extraordinary leaders in the community of Mayors as well as in their own cities and all of the current and former mayor's here today I thank you for your service at a time when local leadership has never mattered more and I want to ask everyone here to help thank my unbelievably talented staff and volunteers each doing the work of ten people living out the values of this project and making it all
thank you to my mom who is here physically and my dad who is here in more ways than he could have ever imagined and to chasten my love yeah I'm pretty fond of them too for giving me the strength to do this and the grounding to be myself as we go for everyone from around South Bend joining us today thank you for giving me the chance to be mayor piece
and for everyone who came from far and wide welcome to South Bend it is a source of deep pleasure to be able to share our hometown with you I'm glad you can see it for yourself because this city's story is such a big part of why I'm doing this I grew up in South Bend in the same neighborhood where Chaston and I live today with our two dogs buddy and Truman my father immigrated to this country because he knew it was the best place in
the world to get an advanced education he became an American citizen and met my mother a young professor who is the daughter of an Army colonel and a piano teacher and they moved here for work settle into a house on the west side and pretty soon after that I came on the scene the south band I grew up in was still recovering from economic disasters that played out before I was even born once in this city we housed the companies that helped power America into
the 20th century think of the forces that built this building we're standing in now and the countless others like it now long gone think of the wealth that was created here picture the thousands of workers who came through these doors every day and the thousands of families that they provided for and think of what it must have been like that day in 1963 when the great Studebaker auto company collapsed in the shock brought our city to its knees buildings like this one
fell quiet and acres of land around us slowly became a rough scape of industrial decline collapsing factories everywhere houses that had been full of life and love and hope stood crumbling and vacant and for the next half-century it took heroic efforts just to keep our city running as population shrank and young people like me grew up believing that the only way to a good life was to get out and many of us did but then some of us came back
we wanted things to change around here and when the national press called us a dying City at the beginning of this decade we took that as a call to arms I ran for mayor in 2011 knowing that nothing like Studebaker would ever come back but believing that we would our city would if we had the courage to reimagine our future and now I can confidently say South Bend is back more people are moving into South Bend
than we've seen in a generation thousands of new jobs have been added in our area billions in investment now there's a long way for us to go but we have changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours and that's why I'm here today to tell a different story than make America great again because there's a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back it comes from people who think
the only way to speak to communities like ours is through resentments and nostalgia they're selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with the problem is that they're telling us to look for greatness in all the wrong places because if there is one thing that the city of South Bend has shown it's that there is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the
word again it is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different so that's why I'm here today I'm here to join you to make a little news my name is Pete Buddha judge they called me mayor Pete I'm a proud son of South Bend Indiana and I am running for president of the United States
I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor more than a little bolt at age 37 to seek the highest office in the land up until recently this was not exactly what I had in mind either for how I was going to spend my eighth year as mayor in my 38th year in this world but we live in a moment that compels us each to act the force is changing our country today our tectonic forces it helped to explain
what made this current presidency even possible that's why this time is not just about winning an election it's about winning an era not just about the next four years it's about preparing our country for a better life in 2030 in 2040 and in the year 2050 for when God willing I get to be the same age as our current president I take that long view because I have to I come from that generation that grew up with school shootings is the norm the
generation that produced the bulk of the troops in the post 9/11 conflicts the generation that is going to be on the business end of climate change for as long as we live we're generation that stands to be the first ever in America to come out worse off economically than our parents if we don't do something truly different this is one of those rare moments in between whole eras in the life of our
nation I was born in another such moment in the early 80s when a half-century of New Deal liberalism gave way to 40 years of Reagan style supply-side conservatism that created the terms for how Democrats as well as Republicans made policy and that era too is now over so if America today feels like a confusing place to live it's because we're on one of those blank pages in between chapters change is coming ready
or not the question of our time is whether families and workers will be defeated by the changes beneath us or whether we will master them and make them work toward a better everyday life for us all in a moment like that calls for hopeful and audacious voices from communities like ours and yes it calls for a new generation of leadership in this country the principles that will guide my campaign for president are simple enough
to fit on a bumper sticker freedom security and democracy first comes freedom something our conservative friends have come to think of as their own but let me tell you freedom does not belong to just one political party freedom has been democratic bedrock ever since the New Deal freedom from want freedom from fear our conservative friends care about freedom but they they only make it part of the way they only see freedom from
freedom from taxes freedom from regulation as though government were the only thing that can make somebody unfree but it's not true your neighbor can make you unfree your cable company can make you unfreedom your freedom depends on a lot more than just the size of your government health care is freedom because you're not free if you can't start a small business when leaving your job means losing your health care consumer protection is freedom because
you're not free if you can't sue your credit card company even after they get caught ripping you off racial justice is freedom because you're not free if there's a veil of mistrust between people of color and the officer is sworn to keep us safe empowering teachers means freedom because you're not free in your own classroom if your ability to do your job is reduced to a number on a page women's equality is freedom
because you're not free if your reproductive health choices are dictated by male politicians with off organized labor Tso's freedom because you're not free if you can't organize for a fair day's pay for a good day's work and take it from chastening me you're not free if a county clerk gets to tell you who you ought to marry because their idea their political beliefs the chance to live a life of your
choosing in keeping with your values that is freedom in its richest sense and we know that good government secures freedom just as much as bad government denies it now let's talk about security the idea that security and patriotism belong to one political party needs to end today we are here to say that there is a lot more to safety and security than putting up a wall from sea to shining sea to those in charge of our border policy
I want to make this clear the greatest nation in the world should have nothing to fear from children fleeing violence and even more importantly even more importantly children fleeing violence ought to have nothing to fear from the greatest country in the world security means cybersecurity and means election security it means keeping us safe in the face of violent white nationalism rearing its ugly head around and let's pick our heads up to face what
might be the greatest security issue of our time climate change in climate disruption no region of our country is immune to that threat we've seen it in the floods in Nebraska the tornadoes in Alabama the hurricane in Puerto Rico and the fires in California we saw it right here in this city where as mayor we had to fire up the operation center the Emergency Operations Center this city twice in two years first came a
thousand-year rainfall and then came a 500-year River flood 18 months apart now by my math the chance of that happening is about 125,000 to 1 so either we should all be heading down to four winds later to try to recreate those odds on the slot or something is changing around us and we're not even having a contest over who's climate plan is better because only one side brought forth any plans at all
if you don't like our plans on climate fun show us yours our economy is on the line our future is on the line lives are on the line so let's call this what it is climate security a life-and-death issue for our generator and now let's talk about democracy because no issue we care about from gun safety to immigration from climate to education to paid family leave none of it will be handled well unless our
democracy is in better shape our democratic republic is an elegant system but lately it hasn't been quite democratic enough it's not Democratic enough if legitimate voters are denied the ability to exercise their rights because one side thinks as a matter of political strategy that they're better off if fewer citizens are able to vote it is hardly democracy if citizens united means that dollars can drown out the will of the people
it's not much of a republic if our districts are drawn so that politicians get to choose their voters and study the other way around it's nowhere near the democracy that I swore to protect with my life when US citizens from Washington DC to Puerto Rico don't even have the same political representation as the rest of us and we can't say it's much of a democracy when twice in my lifetime the electoral college has overruled the
American people why should our vote in Indiana only count once or twice in a century or your vote in Wyoming or New York so let's make it easier to register and to vote let's make our districts fairer let's make our courts less political are our structures more inclusive and yes let's pick our president by Counting up all the ballots and giving it to the woman or man who got the most votes
now I like talking about systems and structures philosophies and theories but nothing about politics is theoretical for me someone said all politics is local I would say all politics is personal time and time again moments in my life have forced me to realize what politics really means I learned it when I went overseas on the orders of the commander in chief when you write a letter and put it in an envelope mark just in case and said it where your
folks can find it you never again lose sight of the stakes and by the way when I was overseas each one of the 119 trips I took outside the wire driving or guarding a vehicle we learned what it is to trust fellow Americans with our lives the men and women the soldiers sailors airmen and Marines and civilians who got in my vehicle they didn't care if I was a Democrat or a Republican the carry defied selected the route with the fewest IAD threats not whether my father
was documented or undocumented when he immigrated the care to fly em for was locked and loaded not whether I was going home to a girlfriend or a boyfriend they just want to come home safe like I did they wondered what everybody wants to do a good job to live well and to come home and making sure that kind of thing happens is what politics is for politics matters because it hits home it hits home at our most vulnerable moments
like the day last fall when I left my mother's hospital bedside to go find my dad across town in the middle of his chemotherapy treatment to let him know she was going to need immediate heart surgery not the kind of thing you put in a text message so I had to go find it by the way mom's fine she's right over there right over there with my amazing in-laws but that's a different story
so that tough day I had a few things going for me as difficult as it was I had father Brian who gave the invocation today who lifted us up with faith and companionship and I had my husband Chester he was right there at the hospital he stayed there he was at the hospital where he belonged because in the eyes of the hospital and the state and the law he was not just someone I loved he was
my lawfully married spouse our marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the US Supreme Court nine women and men sat down in a room and took a vote and they brought me the most important freedom in my life mom started getting better right away dad started getting worse we lost him earlier this year and I watched as I watched things change from him caring for her to her caring for him and the two of us trying to take care of
the two of them once again we found our lives shaped by the decisions of those with power over us decisions that made us better off because some people in Washington made the decision to bring us something called Medicare so when I think about how we had to navigate those tough family decisions I think about how fortunate we were that all we had to think about well was what was right medically for mom and dad both not whether our family was going to go
bankrupt over this that's how government touches our lives it's how policies bring us freedom and when it comes to healthcare I want every American to have that same benefit this is why Washington matters not the political ups and downs not the daily drama of who look good on cable in a committee meeting but the way that a chain of events that begins in one of those stately white buildings reaches into our lives into our homes our
paychecks our doctors offices our marriages that is why this country was invented in the first place and that is what's at stake today at least that's how it's supposed to work when something is grotesque it's hard to look away and the horror show in Washington is mesmerizing it's all-consuming but starting today we're gonna change the channel
sometimes the dark moment brings out the best in us helps us find what is good in us there I say what is great in us because I do believe in American greatness I believe in American values and I believe that we can guide this country and one another to a better place after all running for office is an act of hope you don't do it unless you think the
pulleys and levers of our government can be used and if necessary redesigned to make the life of this nation better for us all you don't do it unless you believe in the power of a law a decision sometimes even just a speech to make the right kind of difference to change our lives for the better to call us to our highest values things get better if we make them better after all you and I stand now in a building there was a symbol of our
city's decline where new jobs are now being created in industries that didn't even exist when they poured this concrete and laid this brick you and I stand in a city that formally incorporated in 1865 the last year of a war that nearly destroyed this country what an act to hope that must have been we stand on the shoulders of optimistic women and men women and men who knew that optimism is not a lack of knowledge it is a source of courage
and it will take courage to move on from our past we're not going back you know if I did get a chance to go back it wouldn't be out of a desire to live in that past if I went into the past I'd go just 20 years back so I could find a teenage boy in the basement of his parents brick house thinking long thoughts as he played the same guitar lick over and over again on his little Stratocaster wondering how he could belong in this world
wondering if his intellectual curiosity means he'll never fit in wondering if his last name will be a stumbling block for the rest of his life wondering what it means when he sometimes feels a certain way about young men he sees in the hall at school that means he'll never wear the uniform never be accepted never know love if I found him and told him what was ahead would he believe me
I can picture it if I could put my arm around him and tell him that he was going to see the world and serve his country that he would not only find belonging in his hometown but be entrusted by its citizens with the duty of leading it in shaping it that he would have a hand in transforming the neighborhood's he knew as a boy and that he would help the lights come back on in that giant factory whose broken windows
loomed like the faces of a ghost over the ballpark where his dad used to take him to games where he wondered if this city was his own to tell him that he'll be alright more than all right to tell him that one rainy April day before he even turns 40 he'll wake up to headlines about whether he's rising too quickly into becoming a top-tier contender for the American president and
and to tell him that on that day when he announces his campaign for president he'll do it with his husband looking on how can you live that story and not believe that America deserves our optimism deserves our courage and deserves our hope yes running for office is an act of hope so is supporting someone running for office so this afternoon are you not hopeful do we not live in a country that can
overcome the bleakness of a challenging and divided moment are you ready to turn the page and start a new chapter in the American story if you join me if you and I rise together to meet this moment one day they will write histories not just about one campaign or one presidency but about the era that began here today in this building where past present and future meet right here this chilly day in South Bend
so cold inside - but we've had it with winter you and I have the chance to usher in a new American spring so with hope in our hearts and with fire in our bellies let's get to work and let's make history
from the beginning my campaign for president has been driven by the awareness that we face not just another presidential election but a transition between one ERA and another a fact of which the current presidency is as much a symptom as a cause I believe that the next three or four years will determine the next 30 or 40 for our country in our world and in that context I'm thankful for this opportunity to share the worldview that shapes my understanding
of foreign policy and national security I do not aspire to deliver a full Budaj edge doctrine today but I will illustrate how my administration would manage global issues I want to lay out how I believe American interests and American values can be aligned across American relationships with a view to everyday life in places like my hometown of South Bend my central purpose is to argue that the world today needs America more than ever but only if America can
be at her best as a mayor from the industrial Midwest as a product of the 9/11 generation and as a veteran of the Afghanistan conflict my own worldview is shaped predictably by my life experience when I arrived in college in the fall of 2000 scholars were debating whether the end of the Cold War amounted to the end of history the United States appeared to be the unchallenged leader of a global order and the new century was expected by many to be peaceful and democratic by
the time I finished my studies in 2007 America was mired in two wars it's a respect even among our allies had plummeted and no one could be certain that the global future would be any better than the past I was a sophomore when the towers fell and war came to my generation I stayed up late debating things like the march toward the Iraq conflict in a student committee room at Harvard's Kennedy School unaware that in a dorm across the street a few students
were in the early stages of coding a web site that would become the engine of the social media revolution a few years later I would find myself feeling like I was answering for America for all her gifts and all her flaws as a student abroad an American first in Tunisia and then at Oxford at a time when the world was growing skeptical about America's leadership in credibility by the weekend of my tenth college reunion I was at Bagram Airfield
in Afghanistan the course of my life altered by American foreign policy and through it I've seen at home in South Bend why foreign policy is not a theoretical discussion for the Americans that I serve from send-off ceremonies for reservists about to be deployed overseas to Union meetings of American autoworkers making German branded cars going to Chinese customers from right in our own st. Joseph County I have seen
the local impact of global engagements the need for a new foreign policy vision could not be more urgent today since the election of the current president the United States hardly has a foreign policy at all unless that seem like a partisan jab I should acknowledge that for the better part of my lifetime it has been difficult to identify a consistent foreign policy in the Democratic Party either while the current administration lacks a coherent
policy it does show a pattern a troubling one when it comes to its conduct abroad this administration has embraced and emboldened autocrats while alienating democracies and allies around the globe it is undermined America's alliances partnerships and treaties it is employed tariffs as tantrums provoked trade wars while disinvesting in the education health care and infrastructure fundamental to our nation's long-term strength it is
set it has set defense spending priorities according to the Wars of the past rather than deterring Wars of the future and it has been hostile to immigration costing us people and skills we need while demonizing those who look or pray differently the pattern is that decisions are made impulsively erratically emotionally and politically often delivered by means of early morning tweet with little regard for
strategy and no preparation for their long-term consequences we need a strategy not just to deal with individual threats rivalries and opportunities but to manage global trends that will define the balance of this half century in which my generation will live the majority of our lives we see workers struggling and inequality growing amid the uneven impacts of globalization and automation we see leaders promise again and again to end
the forever wars only to fall short we see authoritarianism and crony capitalism on the rise globally while democratic values are in retreat here at home we see a season of largely unchallenged American power transitioning to a period shaped by the competition of newly rising economies at all this while our domestic and global institutions become increasingly weakened paralyzed and incapable of meeting the challenges we face and at
the same time strange as it may seem to speak optimistically about America in the world right now I have great hope for the possibility that our moment holds across less than one human lifetime more than a billion people have been lifted out of extreme grinding poverty a global class of young entrepreneurs is emerging from Africa to South Asia while political leaders my age or younger are shaping new political agendas as they lead nations from
Central America to Europe with the touch of a finger on a screen dissidents and Democrats across the globe have been connected and empowered and voices once silenced or shunned voices of women religious and ethnic minorities have been lifted to demand their rights and rightful place in society so faced with this moment of enormous challenge and great possibility it is not enough just to say that we won't
conduct foreign policy by tweet nor would it be honest to promise that we can restore an old order that cannot in any case meet the realities of a new moment Democrats can no more turn the clock back to the 1990s than Republicans can return us to the 1950s and we should not try now much was already broken when this president arrived and he immediately said about smashing whatever remained paradoxically this opens a unique window
in which to grapple with the world as it is in the 21st century with greater urgency and in some ways greater freedom than before I often speak of the need for our politics and policies to contemplate the year 2050 for the year in which I hope to retire after reaching the current age of the current president thinking about the world three to four decades from now is exactly how we need to compete with countries like China because that is how they are planning
thinking and investing now to think this far out in American policy we have to move beyond the news of the day to our deep core principles to cope with enormous change American foreign policy for the future must be securely valued in American values American interests and American relationships first and foremost values the greatest strategic advantage for America has always been the fact that our country has stood for values shared by humanity touching
aspirations felt far beyond our borders however imperfectly we have represented and defended principles of freedom and democracy that stir human beings wherever they live and whenever such principles have been vindicated around the world American strength has grown today we worry about the current administration's abandonment of the American commitment to promoting democratic values but just a few years
ago it was Democrats who expressed skepticism as a Republican administration undertook a democracy promotion effort so violent and so misguided that its fallout very nearly made isolationists of my party to untangle the consequences of that scrambled period we must remember that the lesson of the Iraq disaster is not that there is anything wrong with standing for American values but rather that any action in the name of such
values must be strategic legitimate and constrained by the premise that we only use force when left with no alternative this brings me to the concept of the national interest as any state does we advance our own distinct interests but much depends on the principles we uphold when pursuing them especially in the case of America the next president must set a high bar on the use of force and an exceedingly high bar on doing so unilaterally when America acts alone it
can only be because core interests are at stake and because there is no alternative notably this is not currently true of the situation in Venezuela it is not currently true of the situation around Iran it is the difference between the necessary response to 9/11 in Afghanistan and the self-defeating invasion of Iraq it is in short the difference between Normandy and Saigon which brings us to the third pillar of a
foreign policy vision American relationships our relationships bilateral relationships multinational alliances international institutions are the space in which our policy plays out each must be strengthened if we wish to promote American values and defend American interests with this framework in mind the tasks for the next president are clear first we must put an end to endless war and refocus on future threats
second we must promote American values by working to reverse the rise of authoritarianism abroad third we must treat climate change as the existential security challenges fourth we must update the institutions through which we engage the world to address these 21st century challenges and opportunities and fifth we must do all this while involving citizens across
America in a meaningful conversation about how foreign policy and national security concerned their communities and do more to include their voices and values in formulating our policies not only must America do this in order to prosper but the world also needs America to do these things the world needs an America free from entrapment in endless war and prepared to focus on future threats after 9/11 Congress passed and President George W
Bush signed into law an authorization for the use of military force to eliminate the threat posed by Al Qaeda and to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan that law was barely two pages long yet it has been used for two decades to wage wars and launch military strikes from the mountains of the Hindu Kush to the African Sahel in mobilizing to meet the extremist threat we did achieve a measure of military victory but as the mission drifted the collateral damage to
our national moral authority was enormous and we far too often bargained against our own values Congress abdicated its responsibility on issues of war and peace we spent four trillion dollars and lost thousands of American lives to say nothing of countless civilians caught in the crossfire I fear that someday soon we may receive news of the first US casualty of the 9/11 wars who was born after 9/11 as someone who deployed to that war on the
orders of a president someone who believed back in 2014 that our involvement in Afghanistan was coming to an end and that I was one of the last to turn out the lights the time has come for Congress to repeal and replace that blank check on the use of force and ensure a robust debate on operation we should never again send troops into conflict without a clear definition of their mission and an understanding of
what will come after we should never again find ourselves in a situation like we did in 2017 when four US soldiers were killed on a counterterrorism mission in Nazaire only to have senators from both parties admit that they didn't even realize that we had a thousand troops stationed in that country correcting this is not only a matter of presidential restraint but of renewed congressional oversight the time
for a Congress asleep at the switch must come to an end if members of our military can find the courage to deploy to a war zone then members of our Congress ought to be able to summon the courage to take tough votes on war in peace now our military capabilities exist of course for a reason we stand ready to use force under specific lawful circumstances and when there is no peaceful alternative I believe we should
use force when there is a clear and present threat to the US when it is necessary to deter and defend against an attack on or imminent threat against the United States our citizens at home or abroad or our treaty allies and when we act as part of a legitimate international coalition to prevent genocide or other atrocities but when we meet must use force we must also have an endgame before during and after a deployment of troops we should also
deploy diplomatic development and security assistance to guard against future instability it is not enough to define what we would not do or how we would not get dragged in after all war itself represents a kind of failure and true success lies in preventing conflict this is why we must anticipate and prevent threats around the world in a clear-headed and
forward-looking way among the threats to American and human security nuclear destruction remains paramount this is why preventing the spread of nuclear weapons should remain a core tenet of our global leadership for this reason I will rejoin our international partners and recommit the United States to the Iran nuclear deal whatever its imperfections this was perhaps as close to a true art of the
deal as it gets as even this administration repeatedly certified it was preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons it has helped constrain the military threat that Iran poses to Israel and Europe without leading us down a path to another Middle Eastern war this agreement was concluded not to do Iran a favor but because it is in our national security interest just as a parallel policy of confronting Iran's support for terrorism and abysmal human
rights record reflects our values and security interests now recommitting to diplomacy with Iran will similarly strengthen our hand in North Korea for decades the United States and our allies have successfully deterred North Korean use of nuclear weapons at the same time it is also in the interest of regional security to advance peace on the Korean Peninsula so rather than a zero-sum insistence on full and complete denuclearization
before any peace is possible we can recognize that these two processes can be mutually reinforcing with small steps leading to bigger ones you will not see me exchanging love letters on White House letterhead with a brutal dictator who starves and murders his own people but you will see my administration work to create the conditions that would make it possible to welcome North Korea into the international community but until we can change the present dynamic until
there are good faith and verifiable reverses in North Korea's nuclear program sanctions must remain in place now beyond state-sponsored nuclear proliferation we also face the continued threat of stateless terrorism and extremism at home and abroad the United States can't fix every fragile state where extremism might flourish but with proper legal authorities we should maintain limited focused and specialized
counterterrorism and intelligence missions in places like Afghanistan to reduce the likelihood that such places will become launching pads for attacks on the United States or our allies we must also be proactive in confronting armed extremist threats at home in my Navy counterterrorism training I learned about the ways in which terrorists top priority is to become your top priority so as a nation we have
to decide as we go about our daily lives what level of risk is acceptable when it comes to our privacy versus our security what trade-offs are we willing to accept we must be vigilant in protecting our lives from threats pros posed by terrorists we must be no less vigilant in protecting our liberties from the threat of being undone by our own hand in times of widespread fear and achieving such balance will be
particularly important when we contemplate the possibility of a major security event between now and the next election knowing that in the past decade more Americans have been killed in America by right-wing extremists than by those inspired by Al Qaeda or Isis we need to acknowledge this threat too and redirect appropriate resources to combat right-wing extremism and violent light Nashville the world needs an America ready to
reverse the rise of authoritarianism while revitalizing democracy at home and advancing it among our allies countries with models that fly in the face of our values from Chinese techno authoritarianism to Russian oligarchic capitalism to anti modern theocratic regimes in the Middle East all present a major challenge to us and it is no accident that their hostility to shared values comes as they also present a greater threat to our interests
ironically at the very moment when American prestige and respect is collapsing it has never been more needed that America live up to the values we profess the world needs the best of America right now now our approach to each region in the world should be guided by an understanding of our interests that is true to our values take the case of Russia which we should view not as a
real estate opportunity but as a self-interested disruptive and adversarial actor as the most unequal economy of any major power Russia represents a striking example of what happens when a country attempts to set up capitalism without democracy and the forces unleashed their nationalism xenophobia homophobia and repression of the press are both highly disturbing in that country and disturbingly ascendance in our own country
meanwhile Russia throws its weight around abroad most egregiously of course they're unacceptable interference in our elections which weakened America both by helping to elect an unstable administration and by eroding confidence in our democracy itself we must be ready to deter such behavior in the future through diplomatic economic and even cyber tools and information operations but we must also deal with the real
weaknesses that the Russians exploited not just the gaps in our technology but our capacity to be too easily turned against each other in this sense domestic problems from racism to social isolation have revealed themselves to be national security vulnerabilities we've also seen regionally destabilizing Russian behavior from activities on the Crimean Peninsula and in eastern Ukraine to conduct with regard to inter intermediate-range missiles future
policy toward Russia must include a regional security framework that promotes stability for Eastern Europe and incentivizes Russia to adhere to international norms and central to this will be our partnerships sadly fractured and endangered by this administration but ready to be renewed and reinvigorated seventy years after the founding of NATO we must repair the strained relationships with our European allies not because we owe them or they
owe us but because America is more effective when we work with strong and able partners and when those partners can trust America's word in Latin America to universal values that we support as Americans are at stake casual references to throwing US troops at situations like the crisis in Venezuela will not help but engagement
will that means adding not subtracting to USAID efforts in Central America so that we can better address the crime corruption and poverty that contributes to mass migration in the first place and it means working closely with Mexico one of our largest trading partners knowing how much we have to gain when Mexico is more prosperous and stable and yes it means isolating dictatorship and encouraging democracy working in concert with our Latin American
neighbors on the African continent the winds of change are sweeping aside old regimes and certitudes in Algeria a new generation has risen up against a sclerotic government in Sudan women have led a revolt against a criminal one and in Ethiopia we have seen what it looks like when Hope triumphs over hostility by 2025 nearly one fifth of the world's population will live in the nations of a rising Africa 60% of whose people are now under the age of 25 that continent
now boasts some of the fastest growing economies in the world which have lifted millions out of poverty and into the global marketplace and as African people's demand greater accountability and transparency from their leaders the United States must stand ready to put our values into action to promote empowerment alongside economic engagement from the Arctic to South Asia American
interest will be better served when American behavior aligns with values and norms shared across humanity and as we mark the 30-year anniversary of the Kenan Mann massacre the challenge of China presents perhaps the most pressing example anywhere of the need to stand for American values amid the rise of a potent alternative the Chinese alternative is the international expansion of authoritarian capitalism as we speak the Chinese
government is developing a repressive digital surveillance state in Xinjiang up to 1 million Muslim Weaver's are being interned in so-called re-education camps and China is investing more than a trillion dollars in its belt and Road initiative expanding its political and economic influence by building infrastructure throughout the Pacific Europe Africa and the Americas as they happily fill a vacuum left by American withdrawal of course we can cooperate
with the Chinese on areas of mutual interest from climate disruption to combating terrorism to international peacekeeping operations but we also must be prepared to defend our values interests and relationships we will not be able to meet this challenge by sticking to a 20th century strategy nor will it suffice to reduce the China relationship to a tit for tat trade fight as if all that matters is the export/import balance on dishwashers
meeting the challenge of China means we must maintain investments in a military that can deter aggression and adventurism as with Russia we also need to invest in strategies to deal with less overt threats political interference proxy war cyberattacks and the potential weaponization of economic and technological interdependence but beyond that the new China challenge provides us with an opportunity to come
together across the political divide at least half the battle is at home enhancing our domestic competitiveness and stability the idea that the American Way is superior will be difficult to authenticate as long as our federal government's is liable to shut down over policy disagreements as long as Congress can't deliver even on items of consensus among the American people we will not be very convincing if the world sees China invest more in
infrastructure abroad then we are prepared to invest here at home we cannot compete for the global economic future if we continue to disinvest in education infrastructure health and technology if gross inequality and declining social mobility persist in our country our economic and political system will become less and less respected on the world stage which is why perhaps the single best thing we can do to rollback
authoritarianism abroad is to model the strength of inclusive democratic capitalism right here in the United States strength is more than military power it's our power of inspiration at key moments the world has envied not just our strength but our prosperity not just our prosperity but our Liberty if we lose that we lose what makes America exceptional and I fear we are losing it
quickly it's hard to condemn crackdowns on a free press when our president calls our own news media the enemy of the people it is hard to stand for human rights abroad when we're turning away asylum seekers at our own borders it is hard to promote accountability and the rule of law when foreign governments can curry favor as cheaply as the bill for a few nights stay at the president's hotels and golf courses
our legitimacy abroad rests on our democracy at home so let's improve and revitalize our democracy with ambitious structural reforms let's get money out of politics let's de pol�tica our Supreme Court and yes when we're choosing the leader of our nation let's join the ranks of democratic peoples around the world who select their heads of government by Counting up all the votes and choosing the person
who got the much above all let's lead with our values right here at home President Eisenhower was right to say whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of America we don't need a wall from sea to shining sea what we need is to manage immigration and our border humanely securely and effectively and at a time when authoritarians sea women's empowerment is inherently
threatening and LGBTQ equality is a non-starter we will leave them behind by embracing the diversity of our stories as a strength and when synagogues and mosques have been viciously attacked let us aspire to the example of New Zealand's 38 year old prime minister Jacinda Arc let us emulate the way in which she reacted to the horrific slaughter not with walls but with words of welcome and decisive action we modeled these values
at home in order to be convincing around the world we must also ensure that our relationships around the world reinforce the values that anchor us here at home that means upholding our values when dealing not just with our adversaries but with our allies the Middle East is one of the most important examples of a place where we can and most must uphold our values while advancing our interests we will remain open to working with the regime like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
for the benefit of the American people but we can no longer sell out our deepest values for the sake of fossil fuel access and lucrative business deals if we recognize that the torture and execution of dissidents is wrong then we should have the courage to say that it is wrong on both sides of the Gulf the closer an ally the more important it is that we speak truth to them the security and survival of the Democratic State of Israel has been and continues to be an
attentional essential tenet of u.s. foreign policy and is very much in our national interest which is why neither American nor Israeli leaders should play personal politics with the security of Israel and its neighbors just as an American patriot may oppose the policies of the American president a supporter of Israel may also oppose the policies of the Israeli right-wing government
especially when we see increasingly disturbing signs that the netanyahu government is turning away from peace the suffering of the Palestinian people especially the humanitarian disaster in Gaza has many authors from the extremism of Hamas and the in efficacy of the Palestinian Authority to the indifference of the international community and yes the policies of the current Israeli government and now Gaza
has become a breeding ground for the kind of extremism that only exacerbates threats to Israel and the reason region Israeli and Palestinian citizens should be able to enjoy the freedom to go about their daily lives without fear and to work to achieve economic well-being for their families as Israel's most powerful and most reliable ally the United States has the opportunity to shape a more constructive path with the tough and honest guidance that friendship and
fairness require the current state of affairs cannot endure the pressure of history and the mathematics of demography mean that well before 2050 for Israelis and Palestinians will have come to see either peace or catastrophe a two-state solution that achieves legitimate Palestinian aspirations and meets Israel's security needs remains the only viable way forward and it will be our policy to support such a solution actively
and if Prime Minister Netanyahu makes good on his threat to annex West Bank settlements he should know that a president Budaj would take steps to ensure that American taxpayers won't help foot the bill at home and abroad it is not too late for America to restore her leadership position as a beacon of values that are both universal and at the core of the American project democracy freedom shared security the world does need
America to model our values and the world needs America to prioritize climate security as a mayor who has had to activate my city's Emergency Operations Center for floods that were supposed to come less than once-in-a-lifetime and done so twice in two years I have seen the homeland implications of this threat we've seen warnings from a generation ago realized today in floods in Indiana
tornadoes in Alabama hurricanes in Puerto Rico and the fires in California and despite what we hear from this administration and from far too many Republicans in positions of responsibility climate disruption is here it is no longer a distant or theoretical issue it is a clear and present threat and as traditionally conservative sectors from the business community led by the insurance industry to our own
military leaders repeatedly remind us climate instability is a threat multiplier it can accelerate the spread of pandemics food insecurity and mass migration research even shows a significant link between temperature rise and the frequency of conflict the balance of my lifetime will play out in an era of climate driven international instability in other venues I've had more to say about how America can rise to this national challenge it's an
approach that should include a carbon tax and dividend to reorient our economy around a more sensible reward system it includes quadrupling American R&D to at least twenty five billion dollars a year leading the way on research into renewable energy energy storage and carbon storage I believe it also means we should empower rural America to be part of the
solution helping to unlock the potential of soil management and other 21st century farming techniques and we could offer a new kind of support for cities and towns seeking to reduce their dependence on carbon but today I want to emphasize the potential of climate diplomacy and the kind of world we might build when climate stands alongside democracy and human rights as a central goal and a source of
legitimate legitimacy for nations in global affairs rejoining Paris is just the beginning as one of over 400 mayor's who committed to upholding the Paris goals and having seen how cities are rising to meet this challenge even as our respective national governments lag behind I believe that the US should foster not only international but sub-national engagement to meet a challenge whose solutions could be as unifying as its
threats are universal we would do well to host a Pittsburgh summit of cities to form commitments that will stand alongside the Paris framework among countries building a robust global framework for climate diplomacy is the right thing to do it also benefits American interests not only because we all stand to lose from climate disruption but also because countries that share our values tend to
be countries with a better track record on climate it's hard to believe that it would be a coincidence that extract an extraction economies and polluting societies are so often those with a tendency toward authoritarianism if we promote democracy we will also be promoting climate action and vice-versa and by taking seriously the threat of climate disruption we might go a long way toward improving a climate of global cooperation
so yes the world needs America to lead on climate and forth the world needs America to update the institution's through which we engage with the world ensuring that they reflect the fact that our world is closer to 2054 than it is to 1945 to shape this young century to our advantage we must renew our national security architecture our military certainly but also our intelligence
communications diplomatic and development institutions it begins with taking a hard look at defence the u.s. has long sought to maintain total dominance in conventional war but in the coming decades we are more likely than ever to face insurgencies asymmetric attacks and high-tech strikes with cyber weapons or drones yet our latest defense budget calls for spending more on three virginia-class submarines ten point two
billion dollars then on cyber defenses it proposes spending more on a single frigate than on artificial intelligence and machine learning to adequately prepare for our evolving security challenges we need to look not only at how much we're spending on our military but what we're prioritizing and chief among those priorities must be the sacred obligation we have to take care of the men and women who fight our Wars
half our veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan have applied for long-term disability benefits we owe our veterans the best healthcare through a strong and modern VA which demands a significant investment to expand the quality and quantity of mental health treatment available but caring for veterans also means helping them and their families return to the normalcy they seek and that is
not just a government responsibility it's something all of us can do human connection is the most underrated and important component of community reintegration I am proud that in South Bend we piloted an initiative to do more than say thank you for your service to do more than offer just another website where I live veterans and their families are not viewed as a problem to be solved but is talent to be competed for they are
engineers little league coaches elected officials and I want to enlist our communities to help them give of their extraordinary abilities beyond taking a smarter approach to our defense and our care for veterans we must also rethink our intelligence and communications we owe our intelligence community a deep debt of gratitude for the manner in which they stepped up and safeguarded our security in the years
since 9/11 but for too long they have focused on too few threats in a world where data and disinformation dominate we should revitalize our intelligence services with an investment in new people and a renewed commitment to tools like human intelligence and next-generation information operations the same goes for spreading the right kinds of information it's not enough to combat falsehoods we must also disseminate truth
the nation that helped solidarity rise in Poland to begin the downfall of communism in Europe has let the tools with which we once spread our message become weak and siloed it's time we took an integrated and innovative approach bridging public and private sectors international communications must not be a neglected subset of our global engagement it is a key to helping the world understand who we are and what we
stand for ultimately our national security and foreign affairs strategy will only be as robust and sophisticated as the people we recruit to carry it out the world is not standing still to successfully navigate these dynamics and seize new opportunities will require a new generation of Americans fluent in different languages and cultures comfortable in a digital world deeply committed to the American project a foreign policy that serves our people in
their daily lives can best be made by government officials who represent the full diversity of our people for far too long our national security establishment has not reflected this diversity so we must work to upgrade our hiring practices to promote diversity and excellence and no matter where they come from our finest minds should find it as attractive and compelling to serve in Foggy Bottom or USAID or Langley as it is to work on Wall Street or in
Silicon Valley we should establish flexible career paths for civilians working in defense diplomacy and intelligence with benefits appropriate for a generation that will change professions more often than my parents generation change job titles for those who choose this path it will not always be easy much of this work happens in the most dangerous parts of the world and our foreign service officers and
development officials our intelligence community must know that Congress and their president have their backs are committed to their mission understand and have prepared for the risks and will not abandon them or their mission nor scapegoat them in congressional investigations at the first sign of trouble and will absolutely not use them as political props or paws the world needs America to cultivate a diverse and talented generation of
personnel ready to engage globally and finally the world needs America to be in touch with our own communities a foreign policy for 2054 must be grounded in the everyday lives of communities across the United States one thing I've learned on the job in South Bend is that all politics is not just local but personal for someone and global politics is no exception yet the discussion in the media in the Academy and in official Washington seems
to proceed sometimes as if foreign policy were far off in its impact and meaning one former official recently acknowledged when the national security seems team sat around the Situation Room table we rarely posed the question what will this mean for the middle class in my white house we will because our purpose is abroad are rooted in our aspirations at home
our innovators are empowered to compete in the global marketplace only if our leaders are relentless in ensuring that intellectual property is protected our workers are empowered to secure their fair share of global economic growth only if workers abroad cannot be stripped of labor rights and forced to produce at unfair wages that undercut American workers our Muslim friends and neighbors are empowered to work and live and contribute to our communities only
if their government honors their faith decisions made in the White House Situation Room do reverberate throughout America's living rooms and every decision concerning the South China Sea should be made through the prism of what it means for a place like South Bend in a globalized century no city no community is an island when a manufacturer announces that this trade war with China could potentially cost
the company hundreds of millions this year that matters to the folks who work at their facility on the west side of South Bend globalization is not going away so we must insist on policies that ensure that working families in cities like mine can play a more appealing role in the story of globalization than the role of victim and we do that by reaffirming our long-standing international tradition by tapping the cultural richness of our immigrant
families and by harnessing the potential of global markets we do it by unleashing the full power of the most global institutions on our local soil colleges and universities like this one which teaches more languages than any other school in America training that next generation of global leaders and we do it by ensuring that our local leaders our state and local experts our governor's yes our mayor's are not bystanders in that dialogue
whether the issue is climate change or trade or immigration local leaders should be at the table from the beginning empowered to speak with our national diplomatic commercial and military leaders to thrive in the coming decades we must bring the foreign policy conversation out of Washington and into the rest of the country and bring the rest of the country into the Washington foreign policy conversation when I was deployed living the famous military
rhythm of hurry up and wait I spent much more time reading and reflecting than I usually do at home I thought about how Wars start how they end and how sometimes they don't I thought about the Australian soldier sitting next to me in the hall at Bagram even though nobody attacked his country on 9/11 because that's what partners and allies do I thought about the diplomats and development workers painstakingly brokering cease fires and stabilizing
war-torn regions the Trade Representative somewhere in Geneva whose work would determine whether someone's job at the tool and dye Factory in st. Joe County goes overseas or whether a community like ours would be able to attract foreign investment and after a long day split between processing intelligence at my desk in a modified shipping container and driving my commander across the hauntingly beautiful and violent city of Kabul I'd
carry a laptop up to the roof at midnight pick up a Wi-Fi signal and Skype into a city staff meeting back home in South Bend that tenuous digital link was a reminder that the counter-narcotics efforts of my threat finance cell ultimately mattered to a community on the banks of the st. Joseph River but there was a relationship between the city streets I was navigating in an armored SUV in Afghanistan and the ones I was
responsible for paving in South Bend the world needs America but not just any America not an America that has reduced itself to just one more player scrapping its way through an amoral worldwide scrum for narrow advantage it has to be America at our best the America that the forward-looking vision to do things like confront Nazism and rebuild Europe and even invent the Internet inside a research arm of our Defense Department
it has to be an America that knows how to make better the everyday life of its citizens and of people around the world knowing how much one has to do with the other to do so is to keep our nation safe it is to master change rather than be made small and fearful by it it is to see vindicated the values that make our nation what it is and it is to deserve to be described in terms like greatness none of us will live to see the end of history rather in our lifetimes the
choices of the generations now living may well fashion more than our share of history much will depend on our fidelity to our own values and we will not have to wait until 2050 for to feel the judgment of history on this season this set of moments on which the trajectory of the American project and so much of the future of the modern world will depend the world needs America to be the best it's ever been and now it falls to us to set the bearing of our nation let
us choose well thank you it's an honor to be with you thank you very much hey NBC News fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
the first time I came to this state was as a volunteer to knock on doors for a presidential candidate a young man with a funny name and we knew the stakes were high then the stakes are colossal now this country cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump we will not recognize it if he gets reelected we know what is at stake and we know that he's going to do everything he can to
hold on to power but if you nominate me his playbook isn't gonna work this time around see I don't get helicoptered into a golf course with my name on it while pretending to care about the working class I don't even golf I get around in a Chevy that was built in Ohio by the very same workers this president has let down and I don't go to work in an office in Washington DC my office is about six hours that way down i-80 here in the
Midwest and not the wind up with that office I see the outlines of our ethanol plant which is why I understand the measure of this president's betrayal of American farmers and I know how to talk about it and I don't have to throw myself a military parade to see what a convoy looks like because I was driving one around Afghanistan right about this time this president was taping season seven of the
Celebrity Apprentice so that tough talks knocking to work against me but I didn't just come here to end the era of Donald Trump I'm here to launch the era that must come next because in order to win and in order to lead it's going to take a lot more than the political warfare we've come to accept from Washington DC we already have a divider in chief I am offering a white house that you can look
at on the news and feel your blood pressure go down a little bit and set of up through the roof I am asking you to picture that first day the Sun comes up in this country and Donald Trump is no longer the President of the United States a happy thought for sure an end to the chaos and the corruption and the Tantrums and the tweets but what comes next the sun's going to come up over a country even more divided and torn up
over politics and we are today with crises that still require urgent action a 14-year old will be waiting for action who wrote me to tell me that she has written out a will because she is afraid that her next day at school might be her last a twelve-year-old will be waiting for action who asked me about health care not because she is a young policy buff but because she has juvenile diabetes and is afraid her parents will lose their coverage I am running to be
the president who will stand amid the rubble pick up the pieces of our divided nation and lead us toward real action to do right by Americans who have waited for far too long I am ready to gather up an American majority that is hungry for change that is done with the vision and I have seen that hunger across the country places you might not expect it Shenandoah Iowa where a young man from a farm family stood up to ask me what role agriculture was going to play in ending
climate change I've seen it in Granger Indiana when a diner filled up with conservative Republicans protesting the deportation of a neighbor they knew to be a good man and I'll be seeing it in a few weeks on the morning of Thanksgiving Day because in 2019 in rural Michigan you cannot stop a man from going deer hunting with his husband's father we're ready to build this majority a majority ready to deliver the most progressive reform to
health care in 50 years Medicare for all who want it honoring your decision over whether and when you want it a majority even in the red states to do something about gun violence to do something about climate change to ensure the dignity of every American to tackle systemic racism wherever we find it until your race in this country has no bearing on your health or your wealth your life expectancy or your relationship with law enforcement the American people are
ready to get this done to stand with our teachers to let people of faith know that in our white house you won't have to shake your head and ask yourself whatever happened to I was hungry and you fed me I was a stranger and you welcomed me whatever you did to the least of these you did to me I will not waver from my commitment to our values or back down from the boldness of our ideas but I also will
not tire from the effort to include everyone in this future we are trying to build progressives moderates and Republicans of conscience who are ready for a change the time has come we will fights when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think fighting is the point the point is what lies on the other side of the fight and what lies on the other side of that
fight is the hope of an American experience defined not by exclusion but by belonging that is what we are here to deliver and of talking about hope and belonging sounds optimistic to you for a time like this fine call it optimistic but do not call it naive because I believe these things not based on my age but based on my experience Iowa I have seen in the dust of a warzone Americans who had nothing in common besides the flags on
our shoulders learn to trust each other with our lives I have seen in the ruins of factories my city answer those who said we were a dying community by rising up together to build a better future I have seen what America can do and so have you after all you're looking at someone who has a young man growing up wondered as something deep inside of him meant that he would forever be an outsider would never wear the uniform never be accepted
never know love and now you were looking at that same young man a veteran a mayor happily married asking for your vote for President of the United States that's why I believe in this country Iowans I am asking for you to caucus for me on February 3rd because I know what the presidency is for because we know that the purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president it is the unification of the American people that is why we have the office so
Iowa are you ready to bring this country together are you ready to turn the page to a new era together then let us make history together and we will have a lot to celebrate in November of next year and we will know where to go from there Thank You Iowa Thank You Democrats thank you so much
hello hello Iowa Democrats thank you to the Iowa Democratic Party and thank you to the honorees being acknowledged today for demonstrating that democratic politics and progressive values are alive and well in the American heartland my name is Pete Buda jej they mostly just call me mayor Pete back home I'm here to tell you who I am what I believe and why we're doing this we're doing this because our values are on the line and this season in the life of America's
political development is one to end the idea that American values are property of conservatives and Republicans starting with freedom freedom is not a conservative value it is an American value and while our Republican friends like to talk about freedom like it's theirs alone we know that freedom includes economic freedom and you're not free if you don't have a living wage in this country the GOP has sacrificed its ability to claim
to be the party of freedom especially when we see an attack on women's reproductive freedom that all of us especially men ought to be standing up to defend and yes here in Iowa where you turn heads around the nation ten years ago we know that you're not free if some county clerk gets to tell you who you ought to marry based on their idea of their religion we know that freedom comes by way of organizing that's why we stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with labor and we know that freedom comes by way of education which is why on day one the new president needs to appoint a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education freedom doesn't belong to the Republican Party and neither does patriotism when I got on that great ail c-17 that took me into Afghanistan on the orders of an American president the flag on my shoulder was not a Republican flag it
was an American flag representing the belonging of all of us in the Republic for which it stands so don't let anybody tell you that they own national security not when their vision of security goes no further than putting up a wall from sea to shining sea because that's not going to help with cybersecurity that's not going to help with election security that's not going to help us name and confront the violent white nationalism that presents a clear and present threat
to our country I don't have to tell cedar rapids that the time has come to treat climate disruption as a security issue that it is which is why we should not only rejoin the Paris Accords we ought to have a Pittsburgh summit to bring together American cities and communities to do something about the issue with federal support freedoms are a conservative value patriotism is not a conservative only value and God does not belong to any political party least of
all the one that produced this current president now we got a lot of work to do to vindicate our values to establish a true democracy where money can't out vote people and politicians can't choose their voters by drawing districts the way they'd like a democracy where all US citizens including those of DC and Puerto Rico enjoy proper political representation in our capital and maybe even in this greatest democracy in the
world we might go about choosing our president by giving it to the person who got the most votes now I think we're all more or less of one Accord on our values so the biggest question is how are we going to win and we're not going to win by playing it safe or promising a return to normal we are where we are because normal broke and we Democrats can no more promise to return to the 90s then Republicans can deliver on a promise to return us to the
50s the only thing we can do is to look at that show that this presidents created whatever you want to call it a reality show horror show game show and we're gonna change the channel to something completely different help me change the channel help us win the era help us bring about a new era in the life of this country and we will be glad that it started right here in Iowa thank you and I'll see you on the trail
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage South Bend mayor Pete Buda judge thank you thank you Wow thank you thank you Clear Lake Thank You Iowa Wow what a reception you know how to make somebody feel welcome I'm gonna have to keep coming back up here I'm so glad to be with you if you haven't been following our campaign yet my name is Pete beau de jedge most people just stick with mayor Pete and I'm running
for president because I think our country is running out of time but I also think it's not too late we're living in a moment that's even more serious than what the Trump presidency represents because you got to ask yourself how does a guy like Donald Trump ever get within cheating distance of the Oval Office to begin with that doesn't happen in ordinary times happens if we're already in crisis and we have seen it we've seen it in my part of the
industrial Midwest we've seen it in my generation living with school shootings and climate change in an economy that doesn't work for most of us where GDP can go up stock market can go up in life expectancy can go down tells you something is deeply troubled in this country and it means we're not going to be able to fix it by recycling the same arguments that have dominated Washington for as long as I've been alive we've got to do something completely different now
I'm excited to be in this part of Iowa because this is a great place to remind the country and each other that there is no such thing as a permanently red state or county or precinct but we got to find a new vocabulary and the times we're living in call on us to organize around our values so now is the time we break down the idea that values is a conservative idea especially in our times values like freedom are not conservative values there are American
values and today they have progressive implications were the ones ready to secure freedom in a world where freedom requires that you have access to health care that's freedom too not just cutting a regulation somewhere freedom comes by way of education which is why we need a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education you're not free in this country if you're not able to organize for a good day's pay for a good day's work that's why we stand with
organized labor and women are not free in this country when their access to reproductive health is being dictated by male bosses and male politicians so don't let anybody tell you that the other side is the party of freedom and the same thing by the way goes for patriotism we're gonna break that spell that has people thinking that the flag belongs on one side of the aisle the the flag that was attached to my shoulder when I stepped off of that c-17 in
Afghanistan was not a Republican flag it was an American flag symbolizing among other things the idea that we are able and indeed sometimes required to be critical of our leadership and when we do nobody will question our loyalty to the Republic for which it stands let alone tell us to go back to where we came from let's talk about patriotism let's talk about national security there is no national security when we don't have racial justice let alone when we
have a president who is coddling white nationalist white nationalism is a national security threat to this country we got to name it for what it is and we got to fight it so is climate disruption that's a security challenge so is cyber security and election security and we're not going to meet these 21st century challenges with a 17th century solution like building a wall we're going to do something different now I got about 30 seconds left so let's talk about
political strategy if we want to win we can't look like we're the party are back to normal what we have now isn't working but normal wasn't working either that's part of how we got here and we're not going to win going on this president's show when trying to compete with him because on his show and I don't know what to call it a horror show reality show a couple other words come to mind that I can't say in polite company but if you're on his show even when
you're winning you're losing which is why what we're going to do is pick up the remote and change the channel so can I count on you to help us change the channel can I look to you to help us win not just the era but the future of this country and are we willing to do it in the name of our values then with the fire in our belly and with the hope in our hearts we are going to fix things in this country we're going to do it together and I am
proud to do it with you every step of the way thank you Democrats and I'll see you on the trail thank you thank you thank you so much
