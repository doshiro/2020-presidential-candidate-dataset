I wanted to share some really important news with you : I ' m proud to announce that I ' ve signed on as an original co - sponsor of the Green New Deal in the Senate .
For too long , we have been governed by lawmakers who are beholden to big oil and big coal . They have refused to act on climate change . So it ' s on us to speak the truth , rooted in science fact , not science fiction .
Here ' s the truth : climate change is real , and it is an existential threat to our country , our planet , and our future . With each passing day , the imminent threat of climate change grows - and we see it in everything from more instances of extreme weather to rapidly melting glaciers .
According to a harrowing report from the U . N . Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , we have a shrinking window to take drastic action to cut carbon emissions and make meaningful change to save our planet .
The Green New Deal is a bold plan to drastically shift our country to 100 % clean and renewable energy . We will repair our country ' s crumbling infrastructure , upgrade buildings across the nation , and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions .
We don ' t have much time to make the urgent changes we need to protect ourselves and our planet . Add your name right now to stand with me in support of the Green New Deal .
Bold action takes bold leadership , and I ' m grateful to Representative Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez and Senator Ed Markey for leading the charge on this critical resolution .
We do not fight this fight for our generation alone - but for generations to come . Thank you for taking direct action today .
Climate change is real .
It shouldn ' t need to be said - but considering yesterday ' s decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement , it felt necessary .
Trump ' s decision is a tragic one with catastrophic repercussions for our kids and our grandkids . The justifications for this are irrational and fake at best . Trump himself has called climate change a " Chinese hoax ."
It ' s wrong for America to abdicate our responsibility to address this planetary crisis . Surely , in 2017 , we can all agree that the ability to breathe clean air and live in a safe and healthy environment should be a priority ?
I guess not .
Make no mistake : no responsible government official would recommend abandoning the world community on this issue . Our obligation , both as a global leader and as the planet ' s second largest polluter , is to combat this threat to public health and safety here at home , and abroad . Retreat should never have been an option . It ' s shameful .
I intend to do everything in my power to fight to take action in Washington , as I ' ve been doing since you helped send me to the Senate . But I need you to get involved in your local community to pressure your elected officials to take common sense and meaningful steps to reduce carbon pollution and address climate change . If the White House is going to stand in the way of real progress , then we have to create it ourselves .
Additionally , we must flood Congress with calls - so memorize the number ( 202 ) 224 - 3121 . Add it to your favorites . Keep up the calls on climate change and so many other key issues . They ' re making a difference day - by - day .
And finally , remember that it will be a four year process to withdraw from the Paris Accords . That means that every single time you head to the ballot box between now and then , climate is on the ballot . Your family ' s future is on the ballot . And our ability to save our planet is on the ballot .
We can ' t despair right now . We have to pick ourselves up to fight back and resist together .
Thanks for all you do .
China ' s abysmal human rights record must feature prominently in our policy toward the country . We can ' t ignore China ' s mass detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims in " reeducation camps " in the Xinjiang region , or its widespread abuse of surveillance for political and religious repression . We can ' t ignore Beijing ' s failure to respect the rights and autonomy of Hong Kong ' s people and the Hong Kong government ' s excessive use of force against peaceful protestors . President Trump has consistently turned a blind eye to these abuses in hopes of earning a ' win ' in his trade war , all to no avail .
Under my administration , we will cooperate with China on global issues like climate change , but we won ' t allow human rights abuses to go unchecked . The United States must reclaim our own moral authority and work with like - minded nations to stand up forcefully for human rights in China and around the world .
Yes . President Trump ' s unilateral withdrawal from an agreement that was verifiably preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon - against the warnings of our closest allies , and without any plan for what comes next - was beyond reckless . Since then , we ' ve seen nothing but escalations from both sides . Either the Trump Administration is angling for another disastrous war in the Middle East , or it has spent two years saber - rattling with no endgame .
Based on where things stand now , I would plan to rejoin the JCPOA so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance . At the same time , I would seek negotiations with Iran to extend and supplement some of the nuclear deal ' s existing provisions , and work with our partners to counter Iran ' s destabilizing behavior in the region , including with regard to its ballistic missile program .
Let me start by saying this : I guarantee you I won ' t be exchanging love letters with Kim Jong - un . President Trump has handed Kim one PR victory after the next , all without securing any real concessions , so the next president will have serious work to do .
Ultimately , we can ' t accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state . But it ' s clear that simply demanding complete denuclearization is a recipe for failure ; we must work closely with our allies to contain and reverse the short - term threats posed by Pyongyang as we work toward that long - term goal .
In any negotiations with North Korea , we must proceed with great skepticism given our past experiences . I would consider targeted sanctions relief to improve the lives of the North Korean people if the regime were to take serious , verifiable steps to roll back its nuclear program . And that relief would have to be immediately reversible were they to renege on their commitments .
In both Ukraine and Georgia , Russia has used military force to seize territory and undermine democratically elected governments . Russia ' s illegal occupation of Crimea is a severe violation of the international norms that have guided the world since World War II - as are Russia ' s support for combat operations in eastern Ukraine and its cyber - attacks . Thousands of people have died because of Russia ' s aggression , including 298 civilians killed when a Russian missile shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014 .
As president , I would continue to support Ukraine and ensure the U . S . is unequivocal in affirming Ukraine ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity . I would also prioritize working with the government of Ukraine to build out its military , strengthen its civil society , and combat corruption , while working closely with our European partners on a diplomatic solution . And unlike the current occupant of the White House , I will consistently stand up to Putin in defense of democratic values , human rights , and the international rule of law .
As I have said many times , this war in Afghanistan must come to an end . I was honored to visit with our brave troops and national security professionals there last year , and I ' ll do everything in my power to achieve a political solution - if one hasn ' t been reached already - that allows us to bring them home responsibly in my first term .
Nobody can predict what President Trump will do between now and 2021 , so as soon as I take office , I will bring together our military leaders , national security advisers , and top diplomats to coordinate and implement that withdrawal plan . I fully recognize the importance of diplomacy and development to success in Afghanistan , and I want to ensure that the country is on a path to stability , that we protect the gains that have been made for Afghan women and others , and that it never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists .
First of all , we need to end U . S . support for the catastrophic Saudi - led war in Yemen , which has driven the world ' s worst humanitarian crisis . I voted to do just that earlier this year . I also voted to block the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia that only help continue this atrocity . Unfortunately , President Trump vetoed both of those measures . He has stood in lockstep with Riyadh , even turning a blind eye to the heinous assassination of U . S .- based journalist Jamal Khashoggi .
The United States and Saudi Arabia still have mutual areas of interest , such as counterterrorism , where the Saudis have been strong partners . And we should continue to coordinate on that front . But we need to fundamentally reevaluate our relationship with Saudi Arabia , using our leverage to stand up for American values and interests .
Israel is a critical ally and friend and its security is a top priority . I absolutely support a two - state solution because it is the best way to ensure the existence of a Jewish , democratic , and secure Israel . Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state , in peace and dignity , just as Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people .
While all Americans have an interest in a peaceful resolution to the Arab - Israeli conflict , the fact remains that peace can only be achieved if the parties themselves come to an agreement . The U . S . can - and should - serve as a constructive partner in the process . Unfortunately , while , in the past , the U . S . has been viewed as an honest broker with a strong desire for peace in the region , Trump ' s actions have inflamed tensions in the region , diminished U . S . credibility and influence , and undermined the prospects for peace . As President , I would start by reaffirming the U . S . commitment to Israel ' s security and prosperity , while simultaneously working to rebuild the broken relationship between the United States and the Palestinians . Among all of our international partners , the U . S . is uniquely positioned to facilitate negotiations toward peace , but for that to have any chance of success , we have to start by re - engaging in honest , respectful dialog with both sides .
Make no mistake - Nicolas Maduro is a repressive and corrupt dictator who is responsible for an unfathomable humanitarian crisis . The Venezuelan people deserve the support and solidarity of the United States . We should start by immediately extending Temporary Protected Status to Venezuelans who ' ve fled Maduro ' s brutality , which President Trump has refused to do .
We should also provide additional aid to international humanitarian organizations to be disbursed to Venezuelan residents and refugees . And we should continue to support multilateral diplomatic efforts toward a peaceful transition to legitimate new elections , which must be the ultimate goal .
Finally , we should take U . S . military intervention off the table . National Security Adviser John Bolton would have us believe that the choice in Venezuela is between indifference and invasion . That is a false choice , and I reject it .
The African continent is dynamic , diverse , and full of potential , with the youngest , fastest growing population in the world . There are so many important interests at stake in Africa , from bolstering global security to fostering shared prosperity . The United States must engage now and build strong diplomatic and economic partnerships with these nations or illiberal countries like China and Russia will fill the gaps .
Unfortunately , President Trump is damaging U . S . relationships and opportunities in this important region . His description of African nations as " sh * thole countries " was not only deeply offensive ; it was flat - out wrong . He has undermined U . S . diplomacy and undercut work to strengthen security , prevent pandemics , support democratic institutions , and increase U . S . investment .
As president , I will focus on advancing relationships in Africa that President Trump has let languish - and I will do so in a way that is consistent with American values . We need to stand up for democracy , human rights , and economic freedom and development . I will reinvigorate American diplomacy throughout the continent , support economic growth , and deepen security engagements with African partners .
As I ' ve long said , I will oppose any trade deal that doesn ' t look out for the best interests of American workers and raise environmental standards , and unfortunately the TPP didn ' t pass either test . I also raised concerns at the time about the lack of transparency in the process .
In my administration , labor and civil society groups will always have a seat at the table to ensure that trade agreements do achieve these important objectives . And I think that ' s exactly what we need - pro - labor , pro - environment trade deals - because it ' s clear Donald Trump ' s protectionist approach has been a disaster . His trade war is crushing American farmers , killing American jobs , and punishing American consumers . I would work with our allies in Europe and Asia to confront China on its troubling trade practices , not perpetuate Trump ' s failing tariff war that is being paid for by hard - working Americans .
First , I would rejoin the Paris Agreement , so that the world understands America is serious about meeting the most complex , far - reaching challenge of our time - climate change . If we ' re going to be successful , then countries , states , and cities need to transition away from the dirtiest sources of fuel on the planet . Governments around the world should be bringing dangerous coal - fired power plants offline , not bringing new plants online , and underscoring that necessity should be front and center in every one of our bilateral relationships . In addition to applying diplomatic pressure , the U . S . can better assist partners around the world in making the necessary energy transition by providing technical guidance , policy support , and access to capital .
We should also play a leadership role in compelling international institutions to use their leverage to end subsidies for dirty fuel . And we should invest heavily in clean energy R & D and advanced energy storage and bringing the transformative technologies that have already been developed right here in the U . S . to scale around the world .
The greatest U . S . foreign policy accomplishment has been the post - war community of international institutions , laws , and democratic nations we helped to build . For generations , presidents from both parties established a network of stalwart partners . These countries have contributed to our prosperity and worked with us in war and peace to deal with some of the toughest international crises and to confront a number of generational challenges .
Our biggest mistake has been to jeopardize all that progress and accomplishment by engaging in failed wars that have cost lives , destabilized the regions in which they have been fought , and undermined our leadership in the international community . To make matters worse , the current president seems intent on inflicting further damage to U . S . credibility by disregarding diplomacy , withdrawing from international agreements and institutions , shunning our allies , siding with dictatorships over democracies , and elevating sheer incompetence in his decision - making processes .
thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you oh my heart is full right now thank you everyone let me start I want to thank Libby Schaaf the great mayor of the City of Oakland here for living that incredible
introduction and our longstanding friendship you know our mothers were friends together also here in Oakland and I can ' t thank you Olivia enough for your leadership and your friendship so here we are here we are let me tell you I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland California and as most of you know I was born just a throat at Kaiser hospital and it was just a few miles away that my parents
first met as graduate students at UC Berkeley where they were active in the civil rights movement and they were born half a world apart from each other my father Donald came from Jamaica to study economics my mother Shambala came from India to study the science of fighting disease they came here in pursuit of more than just knowledge like so many others they came in pursuit of a dream and that dream was a dream for themselves for me and for my sister Maya
as children growing up here in the East Bay we were raised by a community with the deep belief in the promise of our country and a deep understanding of the parts of that promise that still remain unfulfilled we were raised in a community where we were taught to see a world beyond just ourselves to be conscious and compassionate about the struggles of all people we were raised to believe public service is a noble
cause and the fight for justice is everyone ' s responsibility in fact my mother used to say don ' t sit around and complain about things do something and basically I think she was basically saying you ' ve got to get up and stand up and don ' t give up the fight and it is this deep - rooted belief that inspired me to become a lawyer and a prosecutor it was just a couple of blocks from this very spot nearly 30
years ago as a young District Attorney I walked into the courtroom for the first time and said the five words that would guide my life ' s work Kamala Harris for the people now now I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed but I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on people ' s lives and its responsibility to give them safety and dignity I knew I wanted to protect people and I knew that the people in our society who are most
often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable I believe and on that point and on that point I believed and on that point I believed then as I do now no one should be left to fight alone because you see in our system of Justice we believe that a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us
that is why when a case is filed it doesn ' t read the name of the victim it reads the people and this is a point I have often explained to console and counsel survivors of crime people who faced great harm often at the hands of someone they trust be it a relative or a bank or a big corporation I would remind them you are not invisible we all stand together because that is the power of the people and my whole life I ' ve only had one client the people
and fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault a fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma for the people meant fighting for a more fair criminal justice system at a time when prevention and redemption were not in the vocabulary or mindset of most district attorneys we created an
initiative to get skills and job training instead of jail time for young people arrested for drugs for the people met fighting from middle - class families who had been defrauded by banks and we ' re losing their homes by the millions in the Great Recession and I ' ll tell you sitting across the table from the big banks I witnessed the arrogance of power wealthy bankers accusing innocent homeowners of fault
as if Wall Street ' s mess was of the people ' s making so we went after the five biggest banks in the United States we won twenty billion dollars and together we passed the strongest anti foreclosure law in the United States of America for the people meant fighting transnational gangs who traffic and drugs and guns and human beings and I saw their sophistication their persistence and their ruthlessness and folks on the subject of transnational
gangs let ' s be perfectly clear the president ' s medieval vanity project is not going to stop them and in the fight for the people to hold this administration accountable I have seen the amazing spirit of the American people during the healthcare fight I saw parents and children with grave illnesses walk the halls of the United States Congress families who had traveled across the country at
incredible sacrifice they came to our nation ' s capitol believing that if their stories were heard and if they were seen their leaders would do the right thing I saw the same thing with our dreamers they came by the thousands by plane train automobile I ' m sure they were sleeping ten deep on someone ' s living room floor and they came because they believed in our democracy and the only country they have ever known as room
I met survivors who shared their deepest and most painful personal experiences who told stories they had never before revealed even to their closest loved ones because they believed that if they were seen that their leaders would do the right thing and protect the highest court in our land and together we took on these battles and to be sure we won and we ' ve lost but we have never stopped fighting
and that ' s why we are here today and that ' s why we are here today we are here knowing we are at an inflection point in the history of our world we are at an inflection point in the history of our nation we are here because the American Dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before and we are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question who are we who are we as
Americans so let ' s answer that question to the world and each other right here and right now America we are better than this we are better than this when we have leaders well bully an attack of Free Press and undermine our Jamaat and democratic institutions that ' s not our America when white supremacists march and murder in Charlottesville or Massacre innocent
worshippers in a Pittsburgh synagogues that ' s not our America when we have children in cages crying for their mothers and fathers don ' t you dare call that border security that ' s a human rights abuse when we have leaders to attack public schools and vilify public schoolteachers that is not our America when bankers who crashed our economy get bonuses but the workers who brought our kids country
back can ' t even get a raise that ' s not our America and when American families are barely living paycheck to paycheck what is this administration ' s response their response is to try and take health care away from millions of families their response is to give away a trillion dollars to the biggest corporations in this country and their response is to blame immigrants as the source of all our problems
and guys let ' s understand what ' s happening here people and power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other but that is not our story that is not who we are that is not our America you see our United States of America is not about us versus them it ' s about we the people and in this moment we must all speak truth about what is happening we must seek truth speak truth and fight for the
truth so let ' s speak some truth let ' s be truth about our economy our economy today is not working for working people the cost of living is going up but paychecks aren ' t keeping up for so many Americans a decent retirement feels out of reach and the American Dream feels out of touch the truth is our people are drowning in debt record student loan debt car loan debt credit
card debt resorting to payday lenders because you can ' t keep up with the bills people are drowning in America we have a whole generation of Americans living with a sinking fear that they won ' t do as well as their parents and let ' s speak another truth about our economy women are paid on average 80 cents on the dollar black women 63 cents Latinas 53 cents and here ' s the thing and here ' s the thing when we lift up the women of our country we lift up the
children of our country we lift up the families of our country and society benefits let ' s speak another truth big pharmaceutical companies have unleashed an opioid crisis from the California coast to the mountains of West Virginia and people once and for all we have got to call drug addiction what it is a national public health emergency and what we don ' t need is another war on drugs let ' s speak truth climate change
is real and it is happening everybody here knows from wildfires in the West to hurricanes in the east to floods and droughts in the heartland but we ' re not gonna buy the lie we ' re gonna act based on science fact not science fiction and let ' s speak and uncomfortable but honest truth with one another racism sexism anti - semitism homophobia transphobia are real in this country
and they are age - old forms of hate with new fuel and we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it let ' s also speak the truth that too many unarmed black men and women are killed in America too many black and brown Americans are being locked up from mass incarceration to cash bail to policing our criminal justice system needs drastic repair let ' s speak that true and let ' s speak truth under this
administration America ' s position in the world has never been weaker when democratic values are under attack around the globe when authoritarianism is on the march when nuclear proliferation is on the rise when we have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware let ' s beat that true and let ' s speak about let ' s speak truth about what are clear and present dangers and let ' s speak the biggest truth the biggest
truth of all in the face of powerful forces trying to sow hate and division among us the truth is that as Americans we have so much more in common than what separates let ' s pick that true and let ' s let ' s not try let ' s not buy that stuff that some folks are trying to peddle let ' s never forget that on the fundamental issues we all have so much more in common than what separates us and you know some will say what we need to search to find that
common ground here ' s what I say I think we need to recognize we are already standing on common ground I say we rise together or we fall together as one nation indivisible and I want to be perfectly clear I ' m not talking about unity for the sake of unity so hear me out I ' m not talking about unity for the sake of unity I ' m not talking about some facade of unity and I believe we must acknowledge that the word unity has often been used to
shut people up or to preserve the status quo after all let ' s remember when women fought for suffrage those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace let ' s remember when abolitionists spoke out and civil rights workers marched their oppressors said they were dividing the races and violating the word of God but Frederick Douglass said it best and Harriet Tubman and dr . King knew to love the religion of Jesus is to hate the religion of the
slave master when we have true unity no one will be subjugated for others it ' s about fighting for a country with equal treatment collective purpose and freedom for all that ' s who we are that ' s who we are and so I stand before you today I stand before you today clear - eyed about the fight ahead and what has to be done with faith in God with fidelity to
country and with the fighting spirit I got to my mother I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States and I will tell you I ' m running for president because I love my country I love my country I ' m running to be president of the people by the people and for all people I ' m running to fight for an America where the economy works
for working people for an America where you only have to work one job to pay the bills and where hard work is rewarded and where any worker can join a union I am running to declare once and for all that health care is a fundamental right and we will deliver that right with Medicare for all I am running to declare education is a fundamental right
and we will guarantee that right with universal pre - k and debt - free college I am running to guarantee working and middle - class families and overdue pay increase we will deliver the largest working and middle - class tax cut in a generation to $ 500 a month to help America ' s families make ends meet and will pay for it will pay for it by reversing this administration ' s
giveaways to the top I ' m running to fight for an America where our democracy and its institutions are protected against all enemies foreign and domestic which is why I will defend this nation against all threats to our cybersecurity we will secure our elections and our critical infrastructure to protect our democracy
and we will honor our servicemembers and veterans so no one who has served this country has to wait in line for weeks and months to get what they are old when they return home on first day I ' m running to fight for an America where no mother or father has to teach their young son that people may stop him arrest him chase him or kill him because of his race
an America where every parent can send their Tilt children to school without being haunted by the horror of yet another killing spree where we treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women ' s rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself an America where we welcome refugees and bring people out of the shadows and provide a pathway to citizenship
and America where our daughters and our sisters and our mothers and our grandmothers are respected where they live and where they work we ' re reproductive rights are not just protected by the Constitution of the United States but guaranteed in every state I ' ll fight for an America where we keep our word and where we honor our promises because that ' s our America and that ' s
the America I believe in that ' s the America I know we believe in and as we embark on this campaign I will tell you this I am not perfect lord knows I am not perfect but I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect I will lead with integrity and I will speak the truth and of course we know this is not going to be easy guys it ' s not gonna be easy and we know what the
doubters will say it ' s the same thing they ' ve always said they ' ll say it ' s not your time they ' ll say wait your turn they ' ll say the odds are long they ' ll say it can ' t be done but but America ' s story has always been written by people who can see what can be unburdened by what has been that is our story that is our story and as Robert Kennedy many years ago said only those who dare to fail greatly can
ever achieve greatly he also said I do not lightly dismiss the dangers and the difficulties of challenging an incumbent president but these are not ordinary times and this is not an ordinary election he said at stake is not simply the leadership of our party and even our country it is our right to moral leadership of this planet so today I say to you my friends these are not ordinary times and this will not
be an ordinary election but this is our America and so here ' s the thing it ' s up to us it ' s up to us each and every one of us so let ' s remember in this fight we have the power of the people we can achieve the dreams of our parents and grandparents we can heal our nation we can give our children the future they deserve we can reclaim the American dream for every single person in our country and we can restore America ' s moral leadership on this planet
so let ' s do this and let ' s do it together and let ' s start now and I thank you and God bless you and God bless the United States of America
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage California senator Kamala Harris oh it ' s great to be with you it is so great to be with you I this is historic I can ' t believe I ' m standing on this stage thank you and I have to disperse I ' m gonna just ask you I hope to earn your support that you will caucus with me on election night but let me just say that I think we all know this is an inflection moment in the history of our
country it ' s a moment in time that is requiring us each and collectively you look in a mirror and ask a question that question being who are we and I think we all know part of the answer to that question is we are better than this so this is a moment in time for us to fight for the best of who we are and fight we will and this is not a new fight for us we fight for our country that ' s the nature of who we are and so we ' re going to fight because we love our country and
we know its promise and we know we are better than this and I ' ll tell you I come from a family of Fighters my parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement my sister and I joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice in fact my mother she was tough my mother was all of five feet tall but if you ever met her you would have thought she was 10 feet tall and she was the kind of parent who is
she ever came home complaining about something our mother would look at you with a straight face maybe one hand on a hip and she would say well what are you gonna do about it so I decided to run for president of the United States there you go so let ' s talk about the current occupant of the White House for a moment shall we this is but we must its context this is a guy who came in on a campaign that was about looking backward this is about a
guy who came in and has been in office using the power of the voice of the President of the United States in a way that has been about trying to do to us in a way that has been about trying to sow hate and division among us but see we know that one of the greatest strengths about who we are as a people is in our core in our heart we know we all have so much more in common than what separates us so we ' re not gonna buy what he ' s trying to sell because we know
dude got to go do gotta go so we are gonna fight knowing that we have so much more in common than what separates us and the way I think about it is what I call the three in the morning thought you know when you wake up in the middle of the night with that thought that ' s been weighing on you well for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought it is never through the lens of the party with which we ' re registered to vote for the vast majority
of us when we wake up thinking that thought it is never through the lens of some simplistic demographic some pollster put us in and for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought it usually has to do with one of just a very few things our personal health the health of our children our parents for so many can I get a job keep a job pay the bills by the end of the month retire with dignity for our students can I pay off those
student loans for so many families can I help get my family member off their opioid addiction and for our farmers can I keep my business thriving instead of having to look at bankruptcy because of this fragile man ' s in this man ' s fragile ego that has prompted trade policy by tweet so this is a moment in time for us to fight for the America we believe in and in the America we believe in you should only have to work one job to have a roof over your head and put food on
the table and the America we believe in we will acknowledge a climate crisis and treat it with a sense of urgency in the America we believe in a woman will have power over her own body and the right to make decisions about what is in the best interest of her and her family in the America we believe in all people will have health care and cost will not be the barrier in the America we believe in we will pay our teachers their value
understanding how their are helping to raise our kids and we will fight because this is a fight for not only out of optimism and knowing what can be unburdened by what has been this is a fight not only for the soul of our country born out of love of country but this is a fight born out of knowing that this is so much worse what we ever hoped it could be and we are better than this and I promise you I will win thank you
thank you Bob thank you guys so much my goodness I mean oh I am so honored to have your support your advice your counsel your feedback your guidance your love I you know you all know them and you know them up close but I will tell you they are not only leaders here in this state but national leaders and I am just so honored to have your support can we please hear it for the divorce case and Meghan my goodness I mean from the beginning and you know this is a long
process and you stood with me and and you are such an incredible leader and the work that you ' re doing on so many issues speaking as a voice that is such a strong voice for families affordable housing it in a way that is about national leadership this is probably one of the biggest things that we are not talking about in this debate at least not yet which is the issue of affordable housing in America talk about a civil rights issue and you ' ve been such a
leader so can we please hear so thank you all you know there are obviously many other things you could be doing with your time and I want to thank you for spending it here this afternoon with us oh let me share you with you a couple of thoughts I have and some plans and then we ' re going to take questions because I really want to hear from you because I ' m here certainly to talk but I really am excited to listen so that being said I you know I think we all
know this is an inflection moment in the history of our country this is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively as a country to look in a mirror and ask a question that question being who are we and I think we all know that part of answer to that question is we are better than this so this is a moment in time that is requiring us then to fight for the best of who we are and fight we will and you know the way I ' ve been thinking
about it is this if you just step back and think about it for a moment there is nothing that we have gained as a country in terms of progress that did not come with a good fight I mean we are born out of a good fight let ' s remember that as a nation good fight we like a good fight right so we ' re not gonna hear and bemoan and be you know overwhelmed we ' re up for this it ' s really important to remember that well we are up to this and it is a fight porn
than out of optimism it is a fight born out of love of country it is a fight born out of knowing what can be unburdened by what has been we ' re good for this fight and I ' ll tell you I come from a family of Fighters my parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement in the 1960 s my sister Maya and I we joke we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting for justice right and in fact that ' s why I wanted to be a
lawyer because so many of the heroes of that movement were folks like Thurgood Marshall and others that inspired me to want to do that work and then and then with with that training I became a prosecutor because for me it was also about saying that I wanted to have a career which was a career of fighting for sexual assault victims who had been taken advantage of by predators it was fighting for homeowners in the foreclosure crisis and against the
biggest banks of the United States it was fighting for seniors against pharmaceutical companies it was fighting against for - profit colleges that were taking advantage of our students and veterans it was a fight that has always been about saying we will stand strong especially for the most vulnerable and voiceless among us but also any including our fight against prop 8 saying that when it is a matter of anyone being harmed or attacked no one
should be made to fight alone we must always stand with them and so we ' re up to this fight and in particular then the fight before us is to win this election and take back the White House and it ' s about what we know we must do to turn the page to turn the page and here ' s the thing let ' s talk about for a moment the person who currently occupies the White House context we must so that came into office with a slogan that was about make America great again which
were many of us of course required a question again exactly for whom and for all of us made it clear he was talking about going back to something so that required us to ask back to what back before the Voting Rights Act back before the Civil Rights Act back before row v Wade back before the ABA cuz we ' re not going back we ' re not going back no Lima and deeds gotta go so an Oliver dude to go we will need to successfully
prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and I believe it will take a prosecutor to do that quite a long rap sheet because here ' s the thing he betrayed a lot of people he came in making promises that were broken a long trail of failed policies he betrayed people he betrayed the working people of America everyone from our farmers to Auto Workers when he passes a tax bill benefiting the top one percent in the biggest corporations of America a
trade policy so - called bite wheat based on unilateral action formed from a fragile ego that has as you all know our farmers here in this state and other places looking at bankruptcy because of course we ' ve got soybeans rotting in bins why because folks took the time to invest at least over a decade in a market to sell to China which has now been cut off he has betrayed people betrayed people when he said he was going to come in and help people in
terms of getting health care and now he ' s got his Department of Justice working in courtrooms around the country to roll back the advances of the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to tens of millions of people he has betrayed us in terms of our national security now what am I talking about will this the commander in chief of the United States of America has won us as one of her most important responsibilities the job of
concerning herself with the security of our nation and homeland but what are we got in this Donald Trump a so - called commander - in - chief who on the subject of Russia ' s interference in the election of the President of the United States prefers to take the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community what have we seen in terms of betrayal of our national security on the subject of an American student who was tortured and later died
prefers to take the word of a North Korean dictator over the word of the American intelligence community on the subject of a journalist who was assassinated a journalist who had American credentials prefers to take the word of a Saudi prince over the word of the American intelligence community we need a new commander - in - chief and so let ' s be prepared then to prosecute the case and turn the page and here ' s the thing that we know that
Donald Trump doesn ' t get so cool he ' s been spent in full time using the platform and the microphone of the President of the United States by the way that ' s our office not his time he has been using this most powerful tool this microphone went in the hands of the President of the United States in a way that it has been with the net effect about making us weaker why because he ' s been spending full time trying to sow hate and division among us but what he
doesn ' t get and what we know it ' s the vast majority of us know we have so much more in common than what separates us and that is why we will win this election and that is why we will win this election because while he is trying to get us point fingers at each other we know regardless of where you live what coast you ' re on regardless of what some demographer says and some pollster says about who you are what we know as Americans is that the vast majority of
us have so much more in common than what separates us and we know that is our strength and it is with the strength of that knowledge that we will win this election and so yes all I think about it here ' s why cuz you ' re saying to me we ' ll come on why do you say we have more in common than what separates us well let me just tell you from every personal and
professional experience I ' ve had I know it to be true I have lived in many places I have met many people and the thing I know is this I know that when people wake up in the middle of the night the in the morning that witching hour some people refer it to writers the witching hour when we wake up in the middle of the night with that thing that ' s been weighing on us for the vast majority of us we are having the same thought for the vast majority of us
when we wake up at 3 o ' clock in the morning that thought is never occurring to us through the lens of the party with which were registered to vote when we wake up thinking that thought it is never through the lens of some demographic some pollster put us in and for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought it usually has to do with one of just a very few things our personal health the health of our children our parents for so many
Americans can I get a job keep it job pay the bills by the end of the month retire with dignity for students can I pay off those student loans for so many families Iowa knows this that can I help my family member get off their opioid or their drug addiction for so many of the seniors in our country do I have to make a choice between whether I fill my prescription I fill my refrigerator the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and so
when I think about our march toward 2020 that is the lens through which I think about it and I ' ll tell you as a Democrat I also say this I reject the notion that some Democrats are trying to push let ' s say when you ' re in the Midwest you have one conversation when you ' re down south that ' s a different conversation we ' re on the coast that ' s a different conversation because I know when the vast majority of us wake up in the middle of
we have the same values we have the same concerns we have the same dreams and hopes for the children in our lives and that ' s the message we are going to be talking about and it will be our winning message as we take back our country and I also say this when we think about the issues let ' s also prioritize knowing that you know I ' ve been doing town halls around the country I ' ve been to rallies around the country it is rarely a question that
anyone will bring up so let ' s debate ideology on the spectrum between socialism and capitalism we ' re talking about what we need to do in this election let ' s talk about real things that wake people up in the middle of the night when I ' m talking to folks beer in the grocery store you know I ' m in airports a lot people are saying hey tell me what the vision for the future is because yeah we had some good old days but I ' m not really looking forward
to going back we need to go forward so that ' s how I ' m thinking about this election and what I ' m thinking about then is what we need to do to prioritize the issues that keep people up at night such as what are we doing about the issue of healthcare what are we doing when we know 30 million Americans are going without health care as we speak what are we doing about the fact that one in four diabetes patients cannot afford their insulin what are we doing
about the fact that even people who have insurance may not want to go into the emergency room of the hospital with their sick child because then they ' re gonna walk out of those sliding glass doors with at least a 1 , 000 to a 5 , 000 dollar deductible that they can ' t afford to pay so what are the issues that keep people up at night that is one of them that ' s why I am offering a medicare - for - all plan that says we ' re going to bring down costs we ' re going to
eliminate co - pays and deductibles everyone will have coverage including those with pre - existing conditions and as a point of distinction I am also saying I ' m not going to take away your choice if you want a private plan under medicare - for - all you get that if you want a public plan under medicare - for - all you get that but the bottom line is we ' ve got to operate from the
perspective of understanding health care and access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it what are the issues that keep people up at night well for so many parents are those who parent children and that ' s grandparents that ' s aunties and uncles we all know the only two groups of people raising our children of parents with grandparents and aunts and uncles and our teachers but we are not paying them their value
it ' s an issue that people know all too well that in our public schools 94 % of our teachers are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies that teachers make 11 % less than similarly educated professionals which is why my plan is the first time in the history of our country a plan to make a federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap which here in Iowa ' s twelve thousand two hundred dollars a year
$ 12 , 200 a year in most places that ' s a year ' s worth the mortgage payments or a year ' s worth the grocery bills are putting a significant dent in student loan debt which is one of the greatest barriers to our students coming out and joining a profession for which they have a passion what keeps people up at night well for so many of our children elementary middle high school students it ' s the fact that they start at school a couple of weeks ago and had to endure
a drill during which they have learned about how they should crouch in a corner or hide in a closet in the event there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school it is terrorizing our children and when they ask us why did we have to have that drill we have to tell them because these people in the United States Congress have not had the courage to act they have rejected they are not listening they are not listening and they ' ve done nothing on an
issue that is really pretty basic assault weapons assault weapons were designed to kill a lot of people quickly there is no reason they should be available on the streets of a civil society why do we need background checks well it ' s really pretty basic and by the way I reject a false choice you either in favor the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone ' s guns away I ' m in favor of the Second Amendment but I know we need background checks I ' m going to
tell you why well first of all because as a prosecutor I have personally heard more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you as the Attorney General of California where I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you I have seen as someone who has prosecuted prosecuted homicide cases while autopsy photographs and I care to tell you so background checks why well
because you just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they ' ve been found by a court to be a danger to themselves or others you just might want to know before someone can buy a lethal weapon if they have been convicted by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt of a crime of violence so I ' m going to tell you what I ' m prepared to do I ' ll give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together on this put a bill on my
desk for signature and if they do not I will take executive action and put in place a background check for fine and ban the importation of assault weapons HR person what ' s keeping people up at night hurricanes floods wildfires what ' s causing it well we ' re in a climate crisis and there is a failure of leadership that is beyond beyond excuse or tolerance and if this is probably one of the most urgent reasons why we needed a President of the United States
so I am offering a green new deal that has been described as one of the most aggressive and progressive which says that by 2045 we will have a clean economy we will invest in renewable energy I would know so well you ' ve been such a leader on this and investment in renewable energies and this is about jobs it is about also empowering often overlooked and ignored communities and
it is also about holding the big polluters accountable which I have taken on because let ' s be really clear about this if you ask why isn ' t Washington DC acting well I ' ve now been there two years and some months it ' s extraordinary how feckless some people are and when they ' re when they ' re walking around lobbyists who write a lot of checks the the influence of these industries that are polluting the air we breathe and the water we drink we need we need
leadership that has prepared based on a demonstration of ability to take them on and to do the right thing on this issue I have that history I have taken them on and I will do that as president so there are many other issues to discuss but you know I just I ' m gonna close my comments so I can start hearing for me but just also discussing at this phase of the campaign what I think is an elephant or maybe even a donkey in the
room which is this issue of electability yeah I ' m going there I ' m going there so you know I just have to tell you and there a lot of new friends here this is not a new conversation for me I ' ve heard it every race of everyone I heard it when I ran for District Attorney and people said no but they ' re not gonna be ready for you no one like you has done it before not based on your race not based on your gender not based on your platform that was about being
progressive and making sure that we are trying to deal with and end the mass incarceration problem that America has people said it can ' t be done and I didn ' t listen and I but here ' s the important part and I know we got a lot of media people here here ' s the important part not only did I not listen the people didn ' t listen the people do and I became the first woman in that office and the first woman of color in the history of the state of California
to be elected a DA in a state of 40 million people when I ran for attorney general same thing can ' t be done no one like you has done it before based on race based on gender based on what people expected and what they think about who can do what and I didn ' t listen and the people didn ' t listen either and we won I ' m not listening to that because I have faith I have faith in the American people to know that we will never be burdened by
the assumptions of who can do what based on who historically has done it I know the American people to know we have the ability to believe and see and have faith in what can be unburdened by what has been and in this election the task before us is obviously do gotta go but it ' s so much bigger than that kohrville it ' s so much bigger than that we need to unify our country we need to reclaim our strengths and we need someone on that debate stage who can not
only prosecute the case against Donald Trump in four more years of his administration but who can unify our country knowing how much we have in common and how that has always been the source of not only our strength but our standing in the world because truly even if the outcome of November of 2016 had been different we would still be at a point in time where we would be challenged in the face of all that is in flux around our globe we would still be
challenged in this we ' re sending a sea ascending and descending economies around the world population shifts like we ' ve never seen before in large part because of the climate crisis right we ' re in the midst of an industrial a digital revolution still before us would be the question about who are we what is our standing we would still have to answer that question what is our strength what is our definition and when those
questions are being asked I know that part of the answer is that we have a real commitment to all of the values and the ideals that were the basis of the founding of our country which truly at their essence are about the fact that we are unified around our commonalities and we will always fight for the best of who we are I thank you I thank hello yes okay yay it is on I got to actually say that in front of a roomful
of people so we will take some questions how about right there in the centre to start how will you address the childcare crisis facing families across the nation yeah thank you let me just start by saying I strongly believe that you should judge a society based on how it treats its children and on this and so many other issues we are failing childcare the cost of childcare has increased at such a rate that has not been at the same pace of in wage width
and wages have not been at the same pace and so if we say we are a country that values children and family we have to understand that working families need affordable childcare we have not been giving it to them so one I have a plan that is about what we need to do to have affordable childcare that also I ' m not ending there we ' ll also around what we need around paid family leave at least 12 weeks what we also need to do around equal pay because here let ' s go a little
deeper on that anybody know when the Equal Pay Act was passed by the United States Congress 1963 since 1963 when the United States Congress officially recognized this as an issue right and then fast forward to the year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar black women 61 cents Native American women 58 cents Latinos 53 cents so on that point I ' m actually prepared to say instead of requiring the woman to prove she ' s not being paid as much for
equal work I ' m going to shift the burden to the corporations to prove they ' re paying people equally and if not they ' ll be fine as a way to encourage better behaviors but all of these issues are connected and I appreciate you raising the subject we have got to support working parents and again you know on the debate stage you guys probably see you know all of this question all the time how are you gonna pay for how you ' re gonna pay for
it we got a look at the fact that we have got to invest in the American people and American families and working families and this is one of the most critical issues facing working families in America which is affordable childcare yeah thank you you talked about how Trump ' s been hurting the Iowan farmers one of the other things that his administration ' s done is ramped up the small refinery exemptions giving breaks
to oil companies like Chevron and mobile while hurting the Iowa Renewable Fuels across the state yeah what would the Harris presidency look like as far as sres in the RFS it ' s they would not benefit and so the the RFS are renewable fuel standards have got to go back to a place where it is about recognizing that the the folks who were here in Iowa and not the big oil companies that is not what it was designed to do and he ' s been giving exemptions to them and so that
would be it but I want to go even a step further and talk about this because obviously there is a connection between this and all we need to do around evolving technologies around what we need for a clean economy and I ' ve spent a good amount of time with the farmers of Iowa who are some of by nature and profession the most innovative professionals that you can meet and so my plan also is about investing in farmers and and a lot of the work that ' s
happening in terms of local universities around that the the innovation that is going to actually contribute to our goal of having a clean economy so I think about it in that regard as well but yeah the point that you ' re raising is just another example of the hypocrisy of the Trump administration he says he cares about farmers he says he cares about the little guy and every step of the way it ' s been about supporting corporations and big business
yeah yes hi mother Bridget yes thank you thank you I am a person from the north I ended lived in Canada for quite a few years I am an American citizen and what is concerning me the most about everything else is climate change and particularly in watching the Arctic burn watching the Arctic melt seeing hundreds of reindeer die of starvation we have Arctic lands and yet nothing is being done the Arctic generates or
whether it generates our weather patterns from off the north down through Hudson ' s Bay across the tundra you know what what are we going to do we can ' t do it alone we ' ve got to do it with the other Arctic countries I say well we ' re gonna elect a new president and and and and I ' m I ' m a ask that you will stand in my corner our caucus night but more specifically after we ' re elected immediately we ' re gonna reenter the Paris agreement we ' re going to sign on
to the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol that is about what we do around air conditioning things but also it ' s about implementing my green No Deal and so with a specific emphasis on the jobs that it ' s going to create I don ' t have to tell the people in Iowa that a big part of the issue that is challenging us is what we ' re doing around water policy and so part of my plan is that we ' re going to invest 250 billion dollars in upgrading the water
infrastructure which includes dams big issue here in Iowa in terms of the flooding all I have a specific proposal around what we ' re gonna do to help families who are relying on well water in their backyards and what we need to do to assist them in upgrading because of course a lot of the plans usually deal with with assisting municipalities but not assisting those families that have the wells in their backyard so that ' s part of my proposal
and then it ' s going to be about re - engaging with our allies around the globe there is no question that we have a responsibility to lead on this with our allies but we have done so much you know in the good years we had a clean power plan we you know I if you ' ll pardon my you know referring to my state of California but I ' ve actually seen firsthand what we do as Attorney General I defended some of the strongest laws around greenhouse gas emissions against
the big oil companies that were trying to come into my state and undo them but I know what we can do because you know there ' s a place called Los Angeles California where if any of you visited it about 20 years ago you would have looked up and seen that that sky was brown and then when you were watching the Morning News the local weather reporter would say this is a day where children and seniors should not go outside and then finally people said
leaders have got to lead and leaders lead and now you look up in the sky is blue because we put in place rules around greenhouse gas emissions as so many others I ' ve seen what is capable and what is possible when we change human behaviors in a way that does not require much change to our lifestyle but we ' ll save this planet God gave us and so I know what is possible but it ' s a matter of leadership and it ' s also a matter of holding the polluters
accountable because as far as I ' m concerned we have to have the goals but we also have to hold the polluters accountable and I ' m prepared to do that as well shirts this Thanks this might not be a popular question but you know in the polls aisle it keeps on saying that Biden ' s leading right I ' ve not spoken to one person who ' s following Biden it ' s just how it is and I lived in
Arizona for the last election and didn ' t have the opportunity to vote in the primary just because of the way things happen and I didn ' t feel like I had a voice so I can go to all these events and be inspired and have hope but I am terrified of what happened last time and that it might happen again how what can we do to ensure that can ' t happen and what are you but what ' s happening because I feel like you can turn out but still it ' s we turned out last time and
it ' s a system bigger than us that I feel I lose hope I ' m terrified that ' s what I ' m scared of so just always remember the power is in the people you have to remember that and you have to know that you have to know that and so here ' s the thing first of all you know I just disagree with the pundits when they when they rely too much on 2016 as a predictor of 2020 2020 will not be 2016 guys and for a number of reasons one people are woke
um you know there are a lot of folks who just assumed you know it ' s subtle but you know maybe drunk the kool - aid about oh we ' re in a post - racial Society which was ridiculous um you know and and just kind of assumed that everything was gonna be okay and then we woke up that morning in November of 2016 and realized oh boy can ' t take anything for granted we need to be active 2020 will not be 2016 when
Donald Trump ran he could still run as a kind of reality TV star who was a good deal maker he made all these promises now we ' ve got you know I jokingly referred to the rap sheet but we ' ve got a long list of betrayals and failed policies and people are aware of it the other point I would say yes and and 12 , 000 independent journalists have documented over 12 , 000 rise 12 , 000 ones so there ' s that piece but the other piece of it is this that I would offer
you as to give you a sense of hope that 2020 is not going to be 2016 2018 100 women to the United States in and you ' re here and you ' re here and I ' m saying across our country I ' ve I ' ve had events in snowstorms where people were standing out for hours in line like this summer events in in temperatures that are in excess of a hundred degrees on like a Sunday afternoon people standing in line for two hours I ' m telling people
who have never been involved before including you know Republican men who have been dragged into my events by their daughters so we have to you know hear Coretta Scott King I ' m gonna paraphrase but she had some advice that I often think about and I ' ll paraphrase but she said you know the fight for civil rights and you can think about as the fight for justice they fight for equality the fight for freedom the fight for civil rights must be fought and one
with each generation and when she said that I think she had two points in mind one it is the nature of this fight that whatever gains we make they will not be permanent it ' s the nature of it and so I think the second point that if her admonition is knowing that do not despair do not throw up our hands when it ' s time to roll up our sleeves that ' s the moment we ' re in now look around we ' re all here together well and everyone here could be doing so many
other things with their time and there is so much power and Iowa you know this I mean you make an extraordinary difference in showing people what is possible this is this is part of the history and the role of Iowa to show people what is possible and to inspire them to know what is possible and what can be so I ' m glad you ' re back or that you ' re here and not there and and let ' s just stay engaged and we ' re gonna win this we ' re gonna win
we ' re gonna win all right so we have time for one more question and maza here as a muslim an immigrant i would like to ask you your position in immigration I ' m Middle East yes so you know there ' s a lot to talk about in the Middle East there is the issue of what is happening in terms of Israel an election that is still I think undecided but I also feel very strongly that we have to stop politicizing the issue we ' ve had a president in the White House
who has been making this a partisan issue it is not a nor should it ever be a partisan issue the relationship that we have with Israel is a relationship between the people of America and the people of Israel and we have to maintain that understanding that we have shared values and common interest and their security should be one of our highest priorities the Palestinians must also be given a voice and their ability to leave their own people and we must understand
that on this issue there are human beings on both side who must been given dignity and respect and my goal is that there would be a two - state solution and that that ' s how that should be the goal of the United States let ' s extend that over to the issue of Iran so whether you know there was a healthy debate about the jcpoa called the Iran nuclear deal some people supported it some didn ' t but a lot of work went into it and an agreement was
reached and hey you know some of us argue that it should have been strengthened but it was a good deal and the parties were following the deal and complying with the terms of the deal and then Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of that negotiation pulled out of the deal just pulled us out we entered it into it with allies around the globe and just pulled us out and everything we have seen happen since was predictable and has been predictable and then he
sends out a tweet about locked and loaded and here ' s here ' s how I when I see something like that it not only is the height of irresponsibility whenever a president of the United States is daring to other words that sound like a preparedness to go to war it has to be done understanding the solemn duty that the President of the United States has not only to the relationships with our allies but first and foremost to the families and the military families that
are sending their you know I have kids who are in their 20 s so I ' m going to say children they ' re adults yes but that this is a solemn it promised that we should always make to those families that we will never play politics with the lives of their children and I feel very strongly about that and then we could go on about it down but thank you thank you alright I think that will wrap it up thank you again
it ' s good to be back with you it is great to be back with you and I want to thank the people of Iowa because ever since the first trip I played here as a presidential candidate you have been informing and helping me be a better candidate and you undoubtedly will help me be a better president so I want to thank you in fact one of the first meetings I had was a meeting with a group of teachers here and and and and and that during that
meeting you said to me hey Connolly you know this issue of teacher pay you ' ve been talking about it ' s a national issue and it was because of the conversation that we had that as my first policy proposal I am prepared to make the first federal investment in the history of our country in closing that teacher pay gap I thank you and so that ' s just that ' s part of the backbone part of the backbone of what I believe needs to be done right now which is to make the case
for America make the case for our America and America where health care is a right not a privilege America where teachers are paid their value and America where women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and America where somebody has to work only one job to put food on the table and a roof over their head and America where our children do not have to go to school every day and be concerned about some mass shooter roaming the hallways
of their school and America where we have a president of the United States who knows it is a sign of strength not to beat people down but to lift people up so I like to tell you a little bit about my background so I was raised as a child as a daughter of the civil rights movement my parents met when they were active in that movement my sister and I joked that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting in fact our mother
was all a 5 feet tall if you had ever met her you would have thought she was 7 feet tall and my mother was the kind of person who if you ever came home complaining about something the first thing she do she might put a hand on her hip she look at you and she ' d say so what are you going to do about it so I decided to run for president of the United States and tell you about my background it ' s um I spent a career as a
prosecutor and prey on the most vulnerable murderers and rapists i prosecuted banks i prosecuted big pharmaceutical companies who were preying on the most vulnerable and consumers i prosecuted the big banks and for - profit colleges who were defrauding homeowners and consumers and i ' m gonna tell you somebody else who has defrauded the american people Donald Trump he promised the American people that he would take care of
dreamers he would protect up working people but what did we get instead we got a President of the United States who made a whole lot of promises and betrayed the American people what did we get a lot of broken promises so we need to prosecute the case and I want to tell you there ' s a rap sheet full of evidence to make the case let ' s look at what happened he promised health care and then he tried to rip health care away from
millions of people what ' s that called health care fraud he said he was for working people then he passed a tax bill benefiting the top one percent and the biggest corporations in this country that ' s tax fraud he believes the President of Russia and a North Korean dictator over the word of the American intelligence community securities fraud and then he claims to be the best president we ' ve seen in a generation well I say let ' s call Barack Obama
because that ' s identity fraud so I ' m here to ask for your support I ' m here to ask for your support cuz I am prepared to make the case for America and to prosecute the case against Donald Trump Thank You Iowa
Good evening , Iowa . So we all know why we ' re here . We ' re here ' cause this is a moment . This is a moment where
we have to be prepared
to fight for the best of our country . This is a moment where we need to fight for this country we love ,
for the rule of law , for our system of justice ,
and for our very democracy . We ' re all here to fight . We ' re all here to fight ,
we ' re all here to fight to end that national
nightmare called Donald Trump . And to win , Democrats , to win . It can ' t be about anything other than looking at the future .
It can ' t be about looking at yesterday . We need to be focused on tomorrow . To win , we ' re gonna have
to fight against those who have been trying to push hate and division among us and have Americans turn on each other . To win , we are gonna have to fight for what I know in my heart and in my soul to be true , which is in the beauty of the diversity of who we are as a nation .
We all have so much more in
common than what separates us . And to win , and to win , and to win . We ' re gonna need a nominee on
that stage with Donald Trump who has the ability to go
toe - to - toe with Donald Trump . And Iowa , you ' re lookin ' at her . I ' ve spent my career as a prosecutor . I ' ve only had one client in my entire life and that ' s been the people . Unlike other people .
Unlike others , I ' ve never
represented a corporation . I ' ve never represented a special interest . I started my career
fighting for the people . In fact , the first day I
walked into a courtroom , I spoke five words . Kamala Harris for the people . Those words " for the people "
capture our system of justice because there are two points
when we say for the people . One , in our system of
justice we have rightly said a harm against anyone is
a harm against everyone that no one should ever
be made to fight alone .
And for the people , when I stood there , and when I stand here today ,
also means all the people regardless of race , regardless of gender , regardless of sexual orientation ,
regardless of the party with which they ' re registered to vote , regardless of the language
your grandmother speaks . It means all the people . It was for the people that a large part of the early part of my career was about fighting against those
who molested children and raped women because
it was about saying
that those survivors deserved justice and a voice that gave them
safety without judgment . For the people , when I was
the elected District Attorney of San Francisco , meant
saying that that war on drugs was an abject failure and so I created national models about what it means to give jobs to people who are arrested for drugs . For the people , when I
was the Attorney General of California running the second - largest Department of Justice
in the United States ,
second only to the United
States Department of Justice , meant taking on the biggest
banks in the United States who had engaged in
predatory lending practices and bringing back to the
homeowners of my state $ 20 billion . For the people , as a
United States Senator , meant taking on Jeff Sessions . Taking on Bill Barr . Taking on Brett Kavanaugh . Iowa , I stand here before
you today for the people fully prepared to defeat Donald Trump .
That ' s why I ' m running , for the people . - For the people , for
the people , for the people , for the people , for the people ! - And I will say . - For the people , for the people ! - That in the name of the people , I believe that in 2020 ,
justice is on the ballot . Justice is on the ballot . When in America there is a father who is holding down two
jobs , trying to figure out
how to get through the end of the month , and paying more taxes than
the richest 400 families in America , economic
justice is on the ballot . I ' m running for President to pass the largest middle - class tax
cut we have had in history . You wanna know how we ' re gonna pay for it ? On day one , we ' re gonna
repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 % and the biggest corporations in America . When in America , there is a
mother who is in a parking lot
of a hospital afraid to walk
through the sliding glass doors to get into the emergency
room with her child because she knows if she walks through those sliding glass doors , she ' ll be out of pocket
a $ 4 , 000 deductible , healthcare justice is on the ballot . I am running for President to make sure there is Medicare for all . Not Medicare for some , Medicare for all . To bring down costs and to
ensure that you also get choice because I heard from folks that said ,
" Kamala , don ' t take away my opportunity " to have a private plan ." You ' ll get a public or private plan depending on your choice . When we are looking at
teachers , who across America and here in Iowa , are holding down two and three jobs to get
through the end of the month , education justice is on the ballot . I am running for President to put in place what will be the first
in our nation ' s history
federal investment in
closing the teacher pay gap here in Iowa that ' ll be $ 12 , 200 a year . When all over America , there are woman who are being attacked for their constitutional
right to make decisions about their own bodies , reproductive justice is on the ballot . I am running to ensure every
woman will have her legal and constitutional right and
that not these out of date Republican legislators
tell women what to do with their bodies .
When children in America , regardless of who their
parent voted for for President are afraid to go to school because they are afraid they may get shot , they are afraid there will be a gunman roaming the hallways of their school , justice for children is on the ballot . I am running for President to take executive action if necessary and implement what people who have failed to have courage have not done ,
which is take on the gun
lobby in Washington , D . C . I wanna give a shout - out to Beto because he had the courage . Beto had the courage to say , " Look , you can ' t walk around
talking about gun safety , " but you don ' t have the
courage to figure out " how you ' re gonna take five
million assault weapons " off the streets of America ." Justice is on the ballot . It is time that we fight
and this is a fight
that is about all of us because yes , a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us and here ' s the bottom line , Iowa . Here ' s the bottom line . I do believe , I do believe
that when we overcome these injustices , we will
unlock the promise of America , and the potential of the American people . I do believe , I do believe
that is what we want and need and this is the America , that
is the America that I see . That is the America I believe in . That is the America I know us to be
and that is why I ' m running for President of the United States . Please join me and caucus with me in Kamala ' s Corner . Thank you .
so good to be in the hassle labor I cannot thank you I felt like this is an Academy Award you got I can ' t thank you enough art and Tom and everybody for the leadership you have been providing forever and for the friendship it is really truly good to be home and I cannot thank everyone here enough for the work that you tirelessly do every year every year every year fighting for the voice fighting for the
dignity fighting for the lives of working people in our state and by extension our country thank you thank you thank you thank you and you know as we ' ve talked about it many times the work of leaders in organized labor in California is the work of national leadership we have seen many times over the years as we have stood together how folks will try and come into California because if they think that they can get away with anything that would be about
impeding or getting in the way of workers rights here then they think if they could do it here they could do it anywhere and so the leaders in this room are holding it down not only for this state but for the entire nation and doing it every day tirelessly dedication it is personal it is professional and it is making a difference and as I travel our country meeting with folks I continue to hear stories about how the men and women in
this room are providing leadership on a daily basis for people around our country so I thank you I thank you I thank you and I am proud to be your United States Senator and then I ' m doing this other thing also and so you know I ' ll tell you as relates to this other thing you know people have been asking me why why am i doing it and I tell people because you know I do believe that this is an inflection
moment in the history of our country I think of this as being a moment in time that is requiring us each and collectively to look in a mirror and ask a question that question being who are we and I think what we all know is part of the answer to that question is we are better than this we are better than this so this is a moment that is requiring us to fight for the best of who we are and who but labor knows how to fight and fight effectively and fight in an
organized way and fight on behalf of the people people ask well why are you doing this what ' s going on and I tell them well I believe this is a moment in time that we have got to restore the importance of truth and justice in our country I believe this is a moment in time where we must restore equal opportunity for all Americans to achieve success and well - being and then I ' ll tell you personally I mean part of why I ' m doing
this is I was raised my sister and I we were raised by a mother who was all five feet tall but if you had ever met her you would have thought she was seven feet tall and our mother was the kind of parent who when you came home complaining about something my mother would look at you and she ' d ask okay so what are you gonna do about it so I decided to run for president United States
thank you so let me just I just want to talk a little bit about what I ' m seeing around our country and from the perspective of being where he sent me to Washington DC about two years and some months ago the importance of restoring truth and justice in our country couldn ' t be more real you know there are a lot of people we all know this in our country who are rightly feeling a great deal of distrust in their government and
its institutions and leaders and the thing about a relationship of trust which we all know is that by its very nature a relationship of trust is reciprocal be given your received trust and one of the most important ingredients in trust is truth but there ' s a funny thing about truth speaking truth can often make people quite uncomfortable and for those of us who speak behind a microphone and behind a podium there is an incentive that when
we speak we ' ll make everybody happy they will make everyone feel lovely they will sprinkle lovely dust all over the room and everybody will applaud and job will have been done well speaking truth doesn ' t always accomplish that goal but the other thing about speaking truth is this yes people may walk away from that conversation thinking you know I didn ' t particularly like what I had to hear but they will also walk away from that conversation knowing it was an honest
conversation so let ' s speak some truth in our country and labour has been doing it and does it every day let ' s speak truth America ' s economy is not working for working people let ' s speak that true and how do we know it to be true well in America right now today almost half of American families are $ 400 . 00 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval $ 400 unexpected expense that could be the car breaking down that could be a hospital bill you didn ' t see coming
$ 400 which will up heave that whole family in America today and 99 % of the counties in our country if you are a minimum - wage worker working full time you cannot afford market - rate for a one - bedroom apartment in America just last year 12 million Americans borrowed on average four hundred dollars from the payday lender at an interest rate of often over 300 % that is America today America is not working for working people which is why I am proposing and
this is a combination this proposal of a lot of folks input and many of whom are in this room what I am proposing is that for families who make less than $ 100 , 000 a year as a family they will receive a $ 6 , 000 tax credit that they can receive it up to $ 500 a month economists economists are describing it as what would be the most significant middle - class tax cut we have seen in this country in generations we have got to speak truth let ' s speak truth we are
a nation that pretends and a society that pretends to care about education but not so much the education of other people ' s children let ' s speak that truth I have met and we know more teachers than we care to say who are currently working two and three jobs to pay the bills ninety percent of teachers in public schools today are coming out of their own pocket to pay for school supplies and the reality of it is speaking truth
there are two groups of people who are raising our children parents could be grandparents aunties and uncles and teachers and we are not paying them their value and we have got to get correct on that on average teachers in America are making 10 % and over less than other college graduates of their stature so what I am proposing is what will be the first time in our nation ' s history a federal investment in closing the
teacher pay gap which is currently approximately 13 , 500 dollars a year and let ' s be clear about what thirteen thousand five hundred dollars a year means everybody in this room we know what it means what it means is for most people in our country a year ' s worth of paying the mortgage thirteen thousand five hundred dollars a year means the year ' s worth the groceries thirteen thousand five hundred dollars a year for a lot of those teachers means putting a
significant dent in their student loan debt and here ' s my feeling about this when people want to come to me asking first of all how are you gonna pay with that for that tax credit for the families making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year I ' ll tell you can ' t come up to me Hank I ' ll pay for it right you know how we ' re gonna pay for it on day one we ' re gonna repeal that tax bill that they passed
and I ' d also wanted to say on the issue of these people talking about you know how you gonna pay for it right it ' s funny how they bring up that conversation when you talk about figuring out how public policy can support working people it ' s an interesting thing have you ever noticed how you gonna pay for it when you ' re talking about supporting working families and working people but here ' s
how I think about it I think about it you know people want to praise and people do praise people in the private sector for running efficient businesses and and growing their businesses well you know what they do they don ' t talk about cost they talk about investment and then they talk about measuring the effectiveness of how people are running stuff based on three letters that ' s the analysis three letters and the letters are ROI what ' s the return on their
investment you invest in families you invest in working people in America you ' ll get a great return on that investment select speak truth let ' s speak truth that the unions of America built America ' s middle class let ' s speak truth and while we have people that are trying you know I just heard today somebody said you know you know in Twitter or wherever people are starting to try and call unions special interest groups
that ' s a game their plan that ' s a game their plan and we ' re gonna have to fight against that because that ' s real and we ' re gonna have to push back and we might need to do some educating of people and continue to do some educating to remind people unions built the middle class in this country people so let ' s be some truth art was like where are you coming I was going over there cuz I was going to talk to my
sisters and brothers who are the childcare workforce thank you you are doing to organize a critical workforce and to organize and unionize and understand that listen you can I believe you can judge a society based on how it treats its children you can judge a society based on how it treats its children and one of the greatest expressions of a society ' s love for its
children is to put resources and support in to anybody who is caring for those children teaching those children and investing there for an hour collective future so I could go on and on with the truth but I ' m not gonna keep you out there ' s just one more though that I would like to mention and it is in large part because I ' ve been traveling a lot around our country and and I think that right now there are a lot of very powerful
forces and voices that are trying to sow hate and division among us and I think that when we see that and we know it ' s happening we must speak a fundamental truth and we must speak it from our hearts we must speak it from our souls and that truth in the face of those who are trying to divide us is this the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and we must speak that truth and we must own that truth and we must not allow people
to get away with selling that stuff they ' re trying to sell in their effort to divide us which is their effort to have us lose our strength let ' s not buy that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and here ' s how I think about it I think about it based on what I call the middle of the night thought some people refer to it as the three in the morning thought you know others refer to that as the witching hour you know I ' m talking
about right you know when you wake up in the middle of the night with that thing that ' s been weighing on you sometimes you wake up in a cold sweat well for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that Dawn it is never through the lens of the party with which were registered to vote for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought it is never through the lens of some discrete little simple demographic
upholster put us in and for the vast majority of us wherever we are whoever we are when we wake up thinking that thought it usually has to do with one of just a very few things our personal health the health of our children our parents for so many Americans can I get a job keep a job pay the bills by the end of the month retire with dignity for our students can I pay off those student loans there ' s so many families can I
help get my family member off their opioid addiction the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and so as we march on as we march forward I would ask us to hold on to that strength and I would ask us to also remember that one of the greatest strengths of who we are as a nation is that by our nature and character we are aspirational we are a nation that was founded on noble ideals those ideals that were present when we wrote the
Constitution of the United States and all of its amendments and the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence and those words we spoke in 1776 that we are all and should be treated as equals we are aspirational by nature we are also clear - eyed we ' ve not yet reached those ideals but our strength is that we fight to get there and so I say fight we will and we will fight knowing what can be unburdened by what has been we will fight knowing that
one of the best ways to fight for who we are and who we can be as a nation is to organize is to lift up voices is to give working people a chance to be for them what they deserve in all that they deserve in terms of their dignity and as we move toward the future that we all can see and as we fight for that future let ' s remember this is a fight that is born out of optimism this is a fight that is born out of love of country and knowing what
and be and the bottom line is this years from now people are going to ask us they ' ll look in our eyes each one of us and they will ask us where were you at that inflection moment and what the House of labor is going to be able to respond is more than just how we felt what we will tell people is what we did that we organized folks that we mobilize folks that we
