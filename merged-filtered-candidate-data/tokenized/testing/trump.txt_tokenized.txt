the border as a candidate for president I promised I would fix this crisis and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other our immigration system should be the subject of pride not a source of shame as it is all over the world our immigration system should be the envy of the world not a symbol of disunity and dysfunction the good news is these problems can all be solved but only if we have the political courage to do what is just and what is right both

And I ' m sorry to say that we don ' t have the same definition of terrorism around the table . When I look at Turkey , they now are fighting against those who fight with us , who fought with us , shoulder to shoulder , against ISIS . And sometimes they work with ISIS forces . This is an issue , and this is a strategic issue .
occur those given a high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values we cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists that is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep those

their gracious aid throughout this transition they have been magnificent thank you today ' s ceremony however has very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another but we are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you the people for too long a small group in our nation ' s capital has reaped the rewards of government while

The position to [ Inaudible ] But they haven ' t made it pleasant . They ' re bad people . They hurt a lot of innocent people . People came down here , they got served subpoenas by Mueller and the crew . And they went through two and a half years . They found nothing . So why would you say that ? I think we ' ve had the most productive presidency ever for the first two and a half years .
dollars we could have rebuilt our country twice and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate to launch our national rebuilding I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a one trillion dollar investment in infrastructure of the United States financed through both public and private capital creating millions of new jobs this effort will be guided by two core principles by American and higher
To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security , I would ask , imagine if it was your child , your husband , or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken . To every member of Congress : pass a bill that ends this crisis . To every citizen , call Congress , and tell them to finally , after all of these decades , secure our border .
I can ' t tell you that . I can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened . And when you look at Strzok and Page with the insurance policy , where , you know -- the two lovers , the two great lovers from the FBI . Where he ' s saying , " Oh , she ' s going to win 100 million to nothing , but just in case she loses , we have an insurance policy ."

the regime is squandering the nation ' s wealth and future in a fanatical quest for nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them we must never allow this to happen to stop Iran ' s path to nuclear weapons and missiles I withdrew the United States from the terrible Iran nuclear deal which has very little time remaining did not allow inspection of important sites and did not cover ballistic missiles following our

And you ' d have other countries paying far too little that are very directly benefitted by it and by the United States involvement .
statement a financial statement this is a summary but everything will be filed eventually with the government and we don ' t need extensions or anything we ' ll be filing it right on time we don ' t need anything and it was even reported incorrectly yesterday because they said he had assets of nine billion so it ' s known as the wrong number that ' s the wrong number not assets so they put together this and before I say it I have to say this I made it the old fashioned
Some have suggested a barrier is immoral . Then why do wealthy politicians build walls , fences , and gates around their homes ? They don ' t build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside . The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized .
And just to show how incompetent they were , they spent millions and millions of dollars . Hillary Clinton paid for it and the Democrats , a lot of it had to do , they say , with Ukraine .
And if it ' s historic , you ' re going to see something . Then perhaps even more importantly , you have Durham coming out shortly thereafter . He ' s the U . S . attorney , and he ' s already announced it ' s criminal . And we ' ll see what happens . But --
