One mother had been detained with her child . They were sleeping together on the floor of one of the cages , when , at 3 : 00 am , the guards took her away . She last saw her 7 - year - old son sleeping on the floor . She cried over and over ,  ' I never got to say goodbye . I never got to say goodbye .  ' That was early - June , and she hasn ' t seen him since .
A singular focus on counterterrorism , meanwhile , has dangerously distorted U . S . policies . Here at home , we have allowed an imperial presidency to stretch the Constitution beyond recognition to justify the use of force , with little oversight from Congress . The government has at times defended tactics , such as torture , that are antithetical to American values . Washington has partnered with countries that share neither its goals nor its ideals . Counterterrorism efforts have often undermined other foreign policy priorities , such as reinforcing civilian governance , the rule of law , and human rights abroad . And in some cases , as with U . S . support for Saudi Arabia ' s proxy war in Yemen , U . S . policies risk generating even more extremism .
First , I will appoint trustbusters to review  ' and reverse  ' anti - competitive mergers , including the recent Bayer - Monsanto merger that should never have been approved . I opposed this merger from the start and was deeply disappointed to see the Trump Administration approve it earlier this year . l will appoint regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice who are serious about using the tools they have to produce competitive markets and who are committed to reviewing recent mergers in the agriculture sector and breaking up companies where mergers have reduced competition .
We can make every trade promise equally enforceable , both those terms that help corporations and those that help workers .
I ' m fighting for an America that doesn ' t just work for a thin slice at the top I ' m fighting for an America that works for all of us and that means we ' ve got to have an America where we attack the corruption head - on and America where we know to restructure this economy so all the profits aren ' t going to the top but they ' re going to the hardworking people who get it done and in America that protects it ' s democracy it is an honor to be here with you it is an honor to be
the doctors that people trust we see it when a criminal justice system tears apart black and brown families and the list goes on people crushed by student loan debt we see it over and over we see it when a when a gun industry prevents any any vote on sensible legislation that could save the lives of our children we see it when an oil industry continues to drill and calls all the shots in Washington that is corruption plain and simple and
Farmers are caught in a vise , but the squeeze on family farms isn ' t inevitable . We can make better policy choices  ' and we can begin by leveling the playing field for America ' s family farmers .
The dictators who run those countries stay in power not simply because they hold unwilling populations under brutal control ; they also maintain control through corrupt economic policies that favor the wealthy elites who keep them in power . In China , President Xi Jinping consolidates his power and talks of a  ' great rejuvenation ,  ' while corporations that answer to the state make billionaires out of Communist Party elites . In Russia , President Vladimir Putin attacks free speech and fans nationalism , but his real power derives from the careful intertwining of his government with state - run corporations conveniently overseen by friendly oligarchs .
hello Iowa I ' m here to talk about something that people all across Iowa and all across America know down deep in their bones our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful they make it work for themselves and they leave everyone else behind we see it every time a corporate executive threatens to cut pay and move jobs overseas we see it every time an insurance company won ' t give people denies treatment and denies access to
More - of - everything is great for defense contractors  ' but it ' s a poor replacement for a real strategy . We need to be smarter and faster than those who wish to do us harm . We need to tap our creativity to anticipate and evaluate both risks and responses . And we need to better weigh the long - term costs and benefits of military intervention . That ' s how we ' ll keep Americans safe .
America has a long tradition of breaking up companies when they have become too big and dominant  ' even if they are generally providing good service at a reasonable price .
So let me say it again . This is a prison  ' not a reunification center .
It ' s a good story , with long roots . But in recent decades , something changed .
the professional levels they deserve we can also with that money provide tuition free technical training two - year college four - year college for everybody who wants to get some more education we can help level the playing field put 50 billion dollars into our historically black colleges and universities and we can cancel student loan debt for 95 % of the kids who have student loan debt outstanding you bet and one more thing we can do with that money there is
As a result of this conflict , at least 10 , 000 Yemenis have died , 2 million more are displaced , and 22 million are in need of humanitarian assistance . To make matters worse , a man - made famine has brought nearly 8 million people in Yemen to the brink of starvation .
With fewer competitors entering the market , the big tech companies do not have to compete as aggressively in key areas like protecting our privacy . And some of these companies have grown so powerful that they can bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business , and can act  ' in the words of Mark Zuckerberg  '  ' more like a government than a traditional company .  '
Over the next decade , the expected market for clean energy technology in emerging economies alone is $ 23 trillion . America should dominate this new market . We have the creative researchers , the skilled workers , and the basic infrastructure to develop , manufacture , and export the technology the world needs to confront the existential threat of climate change .
All assets are included in the net worth calculation , which will produce more revenue and reduce opportunities for avoidance and evasion :
Pays zero tax because they are below the $ 50 million threshold
full - time will not support a mama and a baby and keep them out of poverty I am in this fight because I want a government that cares a whole lot less about corporate profits and a whole lot more about families like ours now I made it on through school I got to live my dream I got to be a special needs teacher that was my life long let ' s hear it for America ' s teachers come on now I taught back in the day though and at the end of my first year
The same is true today . OK , I ' d add that they can also be solved by women , too .
As we go into talks with North Korea , though , it is critical that we are clear - eyed about the challenges . Three generations of North Korean dictators have sought a face - to - face meeting with a sitting U . S . president . For Kim Jong Un , such a meeting is a prize in itself - an attempt to legitimize his brutal regime ' s status as a nuclear power . I support talking to our adversaries , but we should be skeptical that he is negotiating in good faith and is willing to halt his nuclear expansion even as he snatches the trophy of a picture with an American president .
For too long , policymakers in Washington have treated foreign and domestic policy as independent of each other , but these boundaries are increasingly fluid . This reality requires us to look beyond our borders , even as we prioritize the safety and prosperity of our own people . It also requires us to reconsider what is truly in our national interest and to pursue policies that work for all Americans , not just giant corporations .
Climate change is exacerbating inequality and injustice at home and abroad . But just , equitable and ambitious climate action , like a Green New Deal , can empower working families , impacted communities and developing nations in a more fair and sustainable economy .
you they can make change without a fight is not going to win that fight and anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory this is a time of crisis and media pundants Washington insiders even some people in our own party don ' t want to admit it they think that running some vague campaign that nibbles around the edges is somehow safe but if the most we can promise is business as usual after
Pays a 2 % tax on the $ 450 million in net worth above the $ 50 million threshold , producing a total annual liability of $ 9 million
None of this requires sacrificing the interests of American businesses ' although it will require some of them to take a longer view . U . S . businesses can compete with the best in the world when given a level playing field , and they are stronger when the American middle class is strong . If our trade and economic policies work for all Americans , shareholders and corporate executives will profit as well .
For the rare taxpayer with an extremely high net worth but liquidity constraints that make it difficult to pay this additional tax , there will be an option to defer payment of the tax for up to five years , with interest . The IRS will also be instructed to create rules for cases where deferment is required in truly exceptional circumstances to prevent unintended negative impacts on an ongoing enterprise or a taxpayer facing unusual circumstances that would advise for delay .
The result of mergers and expansions is immense market power . The top four meat processing companies have 53 % market share . The three big chicken companies have 90 % market share . The two biggest seed companies , Monsanto and DuPont , had 71 % of the corn seed market in 2015  ' before Monsanto merged with Bayer and DuPont merged with Dow . According to conservative estimates , the newly merged Bayer - Monsanto by itself will control  ' more than 37 percent of the U . S . vegetable seed market ' overall , and will control more than half of the market for some vegetables .
As these companies have grown larger and more powerful , they have used their resources and control over the way we use the Internet to squash small businesses and innovation , and substitute their own financial interests for the broader interests of the American people . To restore the balance of power in our democracy , to promote competition , and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last , it ' s time to break up our biggest tech companies .
Guarantee employees at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave ;

I will tackle consolidation in the agriculture and farming sector head on and break the stranglehold a handful of companies have over the market . Here ' s how :
How do we responsibly cut back ? We can start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy . It ' s clear that the Pentagon is captured by the so - called  ' Big Five ' defense contractors - and taxpayers are picking up the bill .
These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform . Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair , reasonable , and nondiscriminatory dealing with users . Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties .
none of us is alone in this fight when I am president we will answer this call together this is not a call for another round of empty promises this is not a call for another round of vague ideas this is a call for real plans to make real changes in our lives and in our communities and yes I have a plan for that too many for today but let me mention just a few to remind everyone some of you may know that I have proposed a two - cent wealth tax on the
America ' s big tech companies have achieved their level of dominance in part based on two strategies :
Wow . Did Washington get that one wrong . Efforts to bring capitalism to the global stage unwittingly helped create the conditions for anti - democratic countries to rise up and lash out .
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , I have seen up close how 17 years of conflict have degraded equipment , sapped forces ' readiness , and forced the postponement of investment in critical military capabilities . It has distracted Washington from growing dangers in other parts of the world : a long - term struggle for power in Asia , a revanchist Russia that threatens Europe , and looming unrest in the Western Hemisphere , including a collapsing state in Venezuela that threatens to disrupt its neighbors . Would - be rivals , for their part , have watched and learned , and they are hard at work developing technologies and tactics to leapfrog the United States , investing heavily in such areas as robotics , cybersecurity , artificial intelligence , synthetic biology , and quantum computing . China is making massive bets in these and other areas in an effort to surpass the United States as a global technological power . Whether the United States will maintain its edge and harness these technologies for good remains an open question .
Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market  ' which will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns , including about privacy .
The 2016 election provided a stark reminder that we must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day . That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes , and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those  ' foreign or domestic  ' who meddle , hack , or undermine them . It means ensuring a meaningful opportunity for every American citizen to vote . And it means fighting for equal justice and protection under the law for all .
are called to this day the boys were all off they had joined military and they were all off it was just my mom and my daddy and me and my daddy had a heart attack a really serious heart attack and we thought he was gonna die he pulled through but he couldn ' t go back to work so long time goes by we lose the family station wagon at night when I go to bed I hear my parents talking and that ' s when I learn words like mortgage and foreclosure and one day I walk into
This federal procurement commitment will revolutionize clean energy production in the United States , help bring down federal , state , and local government emissions , and give the federal government access to the clean energy technology it needs for the third part of my proposal : the Green Marshall Plan .
round the world , democracy is under assault . Authoritarian governments are gaining power , and right - wing demagogues are gaining strength . Movements toward openness and pluralism have stalled . Inequality is growing , transforming rule by the people into rule by wealthy elites . And here in the United States , many Americans seem to accept ' even embrace ' the politics of division and resentment .
Despite America ' s huge investment , these wars have not succeeded even on their own terms . 17 years later , the Middle East remains in shambles . U . S . counterterrorism efforts have often undermined other efforts to reinforce civilian governance , the rule of law , and human rights abroad . We have partnered with countries that share neither our goals nor our values . In some cases , as with our support for Saudi Arabia ' s proxy war in Yemen , U . S . policies risk generating even more extremism . Widespread migration of millions of people seeking safety from war - torn regions has allowed right - wing demagogues to unfairly blame the newcomers for the economic pain of working people at home .
high heels blows her nose and walks to the Sears where she gets a minimum - wage job now that minimum wage job saved our house and it saved our family and if you want to know who I am there ' s the story and here ' s the thing for many years I thought that was a story just about my mother about how no matter how scared you are you reach down find what you need to find you pull it up and you do
Finally , contract chicken farming has already squeezed farmers to the breaking point . To stop the spread of that practice , I believe we should prohibit abusive contract farming in the livestock sector . Our farmers deserve better .
My Green Manufacturing Plan is the first example of economic patriotism in action , and part of how I ' ll implement my commitment to a Green New Deal . With big and bold investments in American research , American industry , and American workers , we can lead the global effort to combat climate change  ' and create more than a million good jobs here at home .
The Yemeni people are suffering . Instead of supporting more bombing , the United States can help bring peace to the region . Congress has an urgent responsibility to act .
To address corruption , we need transparency about the movement of assets across borders .
Donald Trump then Democrats will lose we win when we offer solutions big enough to touch the problems that are in people ' s lives fear and complacency does not win elections hope and courage wins elections I ' m not running some consultant driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone I ' m running a campaign based on a lifetime of fighting for working families I ' m running a campaign from the heart
China presents another challenge - and opportunity - for us in the region . The United States and China have many shared interests and many areas where we cooperate , including on critical security issues like counter - proliferation and pandemic prevention . In other areas , however , China ' s actions are far more aggressive .
enough money there that we can attack the opioid crisis head - on and bring it down a hundred billion dollars over the next ten years into defeating this enemy that is killing our brothers and sisters we can do all of that we can attack the corruption we can restructure our economy and one more we can help protect our democracy we need a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote we need to make
It is also critical that we negotiate from a position of maximum strength . While our diplomats are talented and hard - working , we currently lack an Ambassador to South Korea , our envoy to North Korea recently retired , and many posts in the diplomatic corps are vacant . To achieve our national goals , we need a State Department operating at full capacity .
These are policies that are good for American workers , good for American investors , and good for American businesses .
Tackling Consolidation
In this tradition , my administration would restore competition to the tech sector by taking two major steps :
In April , 20 civilians , many from a single family , were killed while celebrating a wedding in a village in northwest Yemen .
Making Washington Work for Family Farmers
Despite these growing threats , President Trump seems all too comfortable with this rising authoritarianism . He shamefully kowtows to Putin , even in the face of Russian attacks on American democracy . His trade policies toward China are hardly stopping Chinese economic malfeasance . Instead of strengthening crucial alliances with Japan , South Korea , and Europe , he is actively undermining them . And the president has displayed an unsettling enthusiasm for replicating authoritarian language and tactics at home , while autocrats abroad return the compliment by using the president ' s words to justify their own misdeeds .
For generations , America ' s family farmers have passed down a tradition of hard work and independence . Today ' s family farmers share those same core values , but the economics are more and more tenuous . Last year , farmers got less than 15 cents of every dollar that Americans spent on food  ' the lowest amount since the Department of Agriculture began tracking that figure in 1993 .
First , by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as  ' Platform Utilities ' and broken apart from any participant on that platform .
Other countries have learned from this approach . From Hungary to Turkey , from the Philippines to Brazil , wealthy elites work together to grow the state ' s power , while the state works to grow the wealth of those who remain loyal to the leader . This marriage of authoritarianism and corrupt capitalism is a direct threat to the United States , because it undermines the very concept of democracy . It enables corruption to spread across borders and allows authoritarian leaders to foment a global crisis of confidence in democracy . Free and democratic societies , the United States ' included , risk sliding toward corruption and kleptocracy , becoming democracies in name only .
None of this will be easy , but we persist .  ' America is not a country which can be confounded by the appeasers , the defeatists , the backstairs manufacturers of panic ,  ' President Franklin Roosevelt declared in 1941 . He continued :  ' This will of the American people will not be frustrated , either by threats from powerful enemies abroad or by small , selfish groups or individuals at home .  ' His words ring true today . Despite the threats on the horizon , I am confident that we can pursue a foreign policy that works for all Americans ' one that , for generations to come , safeguards government of the people , by the people , and for the people .
4 % annual Billionaire Surtax ( 6 % tax overall ) on household net worth above $ 1 billion
To start , we must address consolidation in the agriculture sector , which is leaving family farmers with fewer choices , thinner margins , and less independence .
According to an independent economic analysis from Moody ' s , my plan will meaningfully increase economic growth and create more than a million new jobs . It will help reverse the massive manufacturing job losses of the last two decades that have hurt middle - class families and hit Black workers and communities hardest  ' all while allowing America to lead the global effort to address climate change .
For example , many farmers are forced to rely on authorized agents to repair their equipment . Companies have built diagnostic software into the equipment that prevents repairs without a code from an authorized agent . That leads to higher prices and costly delays .
Airstrikes and starving children : It &# 39 ; s time the US did something about the horrors in Yemen
Yes , we can - and we must - continue to be vigilant about the threat of terrorism , whether from Afghanistan or anywhere else . But rather than fighting in an Afghan civil war , let ' s help them reach a realistic peace settlement that halts the violence and protects our security . Let ' s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war . It ' s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan  ' starting now .
While counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda and its affiliates would continue , support for the Saudi coalition ' s military operations against the Houthis would stop .
Using Mergers to Limit Competition . Facebook has purchased potential competitors Instagram and WhatsApp . Amazon has used its immense market power to force smaller competitors like Diapers . com to sell at a discounted rate . Google has snapped up the mapping company Waze and the ad company DoubleClick . Rather than blocking these transactions for their negative long - term effects on competition and innovation , government regulators have waved them through .
Before we could get in , CBP insisted we had to watch a government propaganda video . There ' s no other way to describe it  ' it ' s like a movie trailer . It was full of dramatic narration about the  ' illegals ' crossing our border , complete with gory pictures about the threats that these immigrants bring to the United States , from gangs to skin rashes . The star of the show is CBP , which , according to the video , has done a great job driving down the numbers .
I went straight from the airport to the McAllen Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) processing center that is the epicenter of Donald Trump ' s so - called  ' zero - tolerance ' policy . This is where border patrol brings undocumented migrants for intake before they are either released , deported , turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ), or , in the case of unaccompanied or separated children , placed in the custody of Health and Human Services .
The children were quiet . Early afternoon , and they just sat . Some were on thin mats with foil blankets pulled over their heads . They had nothing  ' no books , no toys , no games . They looked shell shocked .
Weak antitrust enforcement has led to a dramatic reduction in competition and innovation in the tech sector . Venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new startups to compete with these big tech companies because it ' s so easy for the big companies to either snap up growing competitors or drive them out of business . The number of tech startups has slumped , there are fewer high - growth young firms typical of the tech industry , and first financing rounds for tech startups have declined 22 % since 2012 .
From Hungary to Turkey , from the Philippines to Brazil , wealthy elites work together to grow the state ' s power while the state works to grow the wealth of those who remain loyal to the leader . That ' s corruption , pure and simple .
The federal procurement commitment will cover a broad spectrum of products , from zero - emission vehicles to energy storage technology to heat pumps to energy efficient light bulbs . It will also include bulk purchases to provide American - made clean energy products to state and local governments at discounted rates .
Green Industrial Mobilization  ' a commitment to using the full power of the federal procurement process to spur innovation and create demand for American - made clean energy products , like how we mobilized our industrial base during World War II . That means a $ 1 . 5 trillion federal procurement commitment over the next ten years to purchase American - made clean , renewable , and emission - free energy products for federal , state , and local use , and for export . The United States is currently projected to spend roughly $ 1 . 5 trillion in the next ten years on defense procurement  ' a bloated number that ' s far beyond what we need to keep ourselves safe . We should spend at least that much on purchasing American - made clean energy technology to address the climate crisis that threatens us all .
a 40 %  ' exit tax ' on the net worth above $ 50 million of any U . S . citizen who renounces their citizenship ; and systematic third - party reporting that builds on existing tax information exchange agreements adopted after the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act .
I don ' t just say it when I show up in this room I say it every time because I believe it and I didn ' t just discover unions when I decided to run for president of the United States I ' ve been putting my money where my mouth is for a long time on this my campaign staff is unionized with a union they picked I ' ve helped other places unionize including the grad students in Boston the casino workers in Las Vegas airport workers in multiple cities I ' ve walked picket lines
We stayed inside at Port Isabel for more than two hours  ' much longer than the 45 minutes we had been promised . When I finally went to bed that night , I thought about something the mothers had told me  ' something that will likely haunt me for a long time .
Married couple with household net worth of $ 100 , 000  ' the median level in the United States
Our needs at home are many : infrastructure to increase connectivity and expand opportunity across the United States . Immigration policies to yield a more robust economy . Education policies to equip future generations without crushing them with debt . High - quality , affordable health care . An economy that is fair and open to entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes . A progressive tax system that requires the wealthy to pay their fair share . A government that is not for sale to the highest bidder .
U . S . foreign policy should not prioritize corporate profits over American families .
We can work with our international partners to crack down on tax havens .
I flew to McAllen , Texas to find out what ' s really happening to immigrant families ripped apart by the Trump administration . There ' s one thing that ' s very clear : The crisis at our border isn ' t over .
for big ideas to take back the Senate and put Mitch McConnell out of a job we need big ideas and here ' s the critical part we need to be willing to fight for them it ' s easy to give up on a big idea but when we give up on big ideas we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas and those people are already in a fight people who are struggling to pay their medical bills
what has to be done to take care of the people you love what I discovered years later is it ' s the story of millions of families across this country people who reach down to what has to be done pull it up and take care of the people they love and it was only years after that that I understood it is also a story about government because when I was in middle school a full - time minimum - wage job with support a family of three today a minimum wage job in America
Let ' s start by reexamining our force structure around the world . The United States has troops deployed in harm ' s way in over a dozen countries today .
Today , climate change poses both an existential threat and a scientific challenge . We already see its effects  ' record floods , devastating wildfires , 100 - year storms that happen every year  ' costing lives and billions of dollars in damage . The world ' s leading experts agree that without aggressive action and serious technological innovation , climate change will cause incredible harm across the world .
Every day , shortsighted domestic policies weaken American national strength . The United States is in the midst of a reverse - Sputnik moment , reducing investments in education and scientific research even as potential adversaries expand them . At a time when growing inequality stifles economic growth , Congress ' response has been a $ 1 . 5 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest Americans . Life expectancy in the United States is falling as overdose deaths skyrocket , and the country ' s health - care system remains ill equipped to respond . Climate change poses a threat to our survival , but the government is gutting environmental regulations and subsidizing fossil fuels at the bidding of wealthy campaign donors . The educational opportunity gap is widening , while politicians starve schools of resources and saddle an entire generation with crippling student debt . And in a desperate attempt to stave off the inevitable reckoning , the president seems bent on keeping Americans frightened and divided .
All household assets held anywhere in the world will be included in the net worth measurement , including residences , closely held businesses , assets held in trust , retirement assets , assets held by minor children , and personal property with a value of $ 50 , 000 or more .
I asked the men held in cage after cage where they were from . Nearly all of them were from El Salvador , Guatemala , or Honduras .
security and we just have to call it it and that ' s what I want to talk about today I want to talk about corruption I want to talk about this cancer on our country corruption and opportunity look I see it this way yeah I was born out in Oklahoma and a family that didn ' t have much we were very much paycheck to paycheck my I have three older brothers I ' m the Layton life baby often referred to as the surprised and by the time I was in middle school the boys as they
in this country all across this country part two of this plan is to make sure that we have access to high - speed Internet everywhere in America that ' s how you participate in a 21 st century economy and part three we need a farm plan that works for independent farmers firm plans for too long have been about big AG we need to have the courage to break up big AG to fight against big AG to say no more sucking every last dollar out of the pockets of our independent
Mergers mean that farmers have fewer and fewer choices for buying and selling , while vertical integration has meant that big agribusinesses face less competition throughout the chain and thus capture more and more of the profits . The result is that farmers are getting a record - low amount of every dollar Americans spend on food , food prices aren ' t going down , and agribusiness CEOs and other corporate executives are raking it in . The CEO of the Chinese group that owns Smithfield  ' a massive meat processing company  ' made $ 291 million in 2017 alone .
That ' s ridiculous . Farmers should be able to repair their own equipment or choose between multiple repair shops . That ' s why I strongly support a national right - to - repair law that empowers farmers to repair their equipment without going to an authorized agent . The national right - to - repair law should require manufacturers of farm equipment to make diagnostic tools , manuals , and other repair - related resources available to any individual or business , not just their own dealerships and authorized agents . This will not only allow individuals to fix their own equipment  ' reducing delays  ' but it will also create competition among dealers and independent repair shops , bringing down prices overall .
The administration ' s decision to double down on US support for the bombing campaign makes a mockery of congressional oversight authority . Overlooking the Saudi - led coalition ' s apparent disregard for international norms and laws of armed conflict does nothing to improve US standing in the world . And continuing to support an ill - conceived proxy war in Yemen does not make America safer .
There is a growing push in Washington to seek an end to this civil war . In this year ' s defense authorization bill , Congress threatened to cut off US support for the Saudi - led coalition ' s operations in Yemen until the Trump administration certified the coalition was making " an urgent and good faith effort " to reduce civilian casualties , alleviate the humanitarian crisis , and negotiate an end to the civil war .
The crisis in Yemen is worsening , and the United States can do something about it . We can hold the Saudi coalition accountable . We can demand that all parties cease the violence . We can support UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths ' peace negotiations .
skin we will answer the call to build an America where federal solutions to local problems are made by communities for Communities in communities where no one is forced to leave their community to find equal opportunity we will answer the call to end mass incarceration in this country and when I am president we will create a country in which like Matthew 25 every human being has value and we turn our backs on no one and we
All three of my brothers served in the military . I know our servicemembers and their families are smart , tough , and resourceful . But a strong military should act as a deterrent so that most of the time , we won ' t have to use it .
Heir with a net worth of $ 20 billion
Amazon Marketplace , Google ' s ad exchange , and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law . Therefore , Amazon Marketplace and Basics , and Google ' s ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart . Google Search would have to be spun off as well .
The longer the day went on , the more questions I had about how the Trump administration plans to fix the crisis they ' ve created at the border . So my last stop of the day was at the Port Isabel Detention Center , about an hour east of McAllen . It ' s one of the largest detention facilities in Texas .
To achieve all these goals , it will be essential to reprioritize diplomacy and reinvest in the State Department and the development agencies ; foreign policy should not be run out of the Pentagon alone . The United States spends only about one percent of its federal budget on foreign aid . Some Americans struggling to make ends meet understandably question the value of U . S . commitments and contributions abroad , and certainly we should expect our partners to pay their fair share . But diplomacy is not about charity ; it is about advancing U . S . interests and preventing problems from morphing into costly wars . Similarly , alliances are not exclusively about principles ; they are about safety in numbers . The world is a big , complicated place , and not even the strongest nation can solve everything on its own . As we face down antidemocratic forces around the world , we will need our allies on our side .
During this period , the United States has been quietly providing intelligence and military advice to the Saudi - led coalition . Our government refuels Saudi coalition warplanes in midair . Our government provides advice and assistance . Our government authorizes the sale of US - made bombs and missiles the coalition uses to conduct this war .
To ensure that this commitment creates good American jobs , it will require that all manufactured products are made in the United States , and that all companies that receive federal contracts , at a minimum :
We toured the center . It is huge  ' multiple buildings isolated on a sun - baked expanse of land far from any town . We didn ' t go to the men ' s area , but the women are held in a large bunk - bed facility with a concrete outdoor exercise area . It ' s locked , double - locked , and triple locked . Tall fences topped with razor wire are everywhere , each backed up by a second row of fences also topped with razor wire .
That ' s not what where we are today . For nearly two decades , this country has been mired in a series of wars  ' conflicts that sap American strength .
It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds , whether in San Bernadino or Charleston , Orlando or Charlottesville , Fort Hood or Pittsburgh . We must speak plainly about all of these incidents . Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS , domestic right - wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values . It is a threat to American safety and security , and we must not tolerate it in the United States of America .
But U . S . trade and economic policies have not delivered for the middle class . For decades , both Democratic and Republican leaders asserted that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats . Great rhetoric , except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the boats of the wealthy while leaving millions of working Americans to drown . Policymakers were willing to sacrifice American jobs in hopes of lowering prices for consumer goods at home and spreading open markets abroad . They pushed former Soviet states to privatize as quickly as possible despite the risk of corruption , and they advocated China ' s accession to the World Trade Organization despite its unfair trading practices . They backed international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund , even as those organizations pushed austerity , deregulation , and privatization ' policies that reduced public faith in both capitalism and democracy and left governments with fewer fiscal levers when economic crises hit .
So what would the Internet look like after all these reforms ?
There ' s no ambiguity on this point . I met with the head of the facility . He said several times that they had no space for children , no way to care for them , and no plans to bring any children to his locked - down complex . When I pressed on what was the plan for reunification of children with their parents , he speculated that HHS ( the Department of Health and Human Services ) would take the children somewhere , but it certainly wasn ' t going to be to his facility . When I asked how long HHS would take , he speculated that it would be weeks , but he said that was up to them . He had his job to do : He would hold these mothers and fathers until he received orders to send them somewhere else . Period .
Finally , a foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home .
CBP said that fathers with children , pregnant women , mothers of children with special needs , and other  ' lucky ones ' who are released from the processing center are sent over to Catholic Charities ' Humanitarian Respite Center for help . That was my next stop in McAllen . Sister Norma , her staff , and volunteers are truly doing God ' s work . Catholic Charities provides food , a shower , clean clothes , and medicine to those who need it . The center tries to explain the complicated process to the people , and the volunteers help them get on a bus to a family member in the United States .
In the process of  ' reunifying ' families , the government may possibly count a family as reunited by sending the child to a distant relative they ' ve never met  ' not their parents . Some relatives may be unwilling to claim these children because it would be inviting ICE to investigate their own families .

The United States has lived through devastating wars in the past , and no sane person wishes to invite conflict between great powers in the future . In fact , many of the trials of our time will require cooperation . But it is essential that we are honest and clear - eyed about the challenges the United States faces . Our democratic allies share our values , and we should join forces to protect not only our collective security but also our shared ideals . In Europe , we should work with our allies to impose strong , targeted penalties on Russia for its attempts to subvert elections , and we should work to help our European allies develop energy independence . In Asia , we should encourage our allies to enhance their multilateral cooperation and build alternatives to China ' s coercive diplomacy . We should also respond to China ' s efforts to force foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in order to gain access to the Chinese market and penalize its theft of U . S . intellectual property . Around the world , we should aggressively promote transparency , call out kleptocracy , and combat the creeping influence of corruption . And we should stand with those who bravely fight for openness and pluralism in Moscow , Beijing , and beyond .
Green Marshall Plan
spoke directly to you and told you about something that was gonna happen in this world so they ' ve got a little bit engaged and they started answering the questions and we made it through to juice time we passed out the juice some cookies in actually have a pretty good class so did it again the next week brought in a different story and started to ask him questions and they got more and more engaged we gave up doing the art we gave up cutting each other ' s hair
has been on the front lines in the fight for justice I ' m here today to let you know how proud I am to stand shoulder to shoulder with Reverend Jackson and with you in this fight and now more than ever the mission and mandate of Rainbow PUSH coalition is vitally important because here ' s the truth the fight for social racial and economic justice is far from over every day we wake up to a new attack attacks on our values attacks on our democracy
The federal government ' s administration of checkoff programs is also rigged against family farmers . Producers of certain commodities , including beef , pork , chicken , eggs , and corn , are required to pay a portion of their sales into the federal checkoff program , which is used to fund national advertising campaigns . But checkoff programs have also been used to squeeze out competition , like when the Egg Board began a campaign against a small mayonnaise company . The Boards that oversee the funds have also mismanaged them and used them to fund lobbying campaigns that benefit large agribusinesses .
The President grabs headlines railing against GM ' s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio and Michigan  ' but his actual policies aren ' t stopping them or others like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers . It ' s time for real change .
Our tax code focuses on taxing income , but a family ' s wealth is also an important measure of how much it has benefitted from the economy and its ability to pay taxes . And judged against wealth , our tax system asks the rich to pay a lot less than everyone else . According to Saez and Zucman , the families in the top 0 . 1 % are projected to owe 3 . 2 % of their wealth in federal , state , and local taxes this year , while the bottom 99 % are projected to owe 7 . 2 %.
Twenty - five years ago , Facebook , Google , and Amazon didn ' t exist . Now they are among the most valuable and well - known companies in the world . It ' s a great story  ' but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets .
We need a new approach to trade , and it should begin with a simple principle : our policies should not prioritize corporate profits over American paychecks . That should be true for NAFTA and true for every deal we cut .
China is on the rise , using its economic might to bludgeon its way onto the world stage and offering a model in which economic gains legitimize oppression . To mask its decline , Russia is provoking the international community with opportunistic harassment and covert attacks  ' including just this week , when Russia seized three Ukrainian Navy ships near Crimea .
Both China and Russia invest heavily in their militaries and other tools of national power . Both hope to shape spheres of influence in their own image . Both are working flat out to remake the global order to suit their own priorities . Both are working to undermine the basic human rights we hold dear . And if we cannot make our government work for all Americans , China and Russia will almost certainly succeed .
family owned somewhere around five dollars this is not an accident this is one deliberate policy in Washington after another and we have to call it out now that step one is to call it out step two is to say we are committed to make real change we are going to attack this corruption head - on I have the biggest anti - corruption bill since Watergate lots of parts to it I ' ll just tell you a couple and lobbying as we know it stop
Defense spending should be set at sustainable levels , and the money saved should be used to fund other forms of international engagement and critical domestic programs . The Pentagon ' s budget has been too large for too long . It is long overdue for an audit that would allow Congress to identify which programs actually benefit American security and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors . Rather than mindlessly buying more of yesterday ' s equipment and allowing foreign countries to dominate the development of critical new technologies , we should recommit to investing in cutting - edge science and technology capabilities at home . When it comes to nonproliferation , we should replace the current bluster and hostility toward nuclear diplomacy with a reinvestment in multilateral arms control and nonproliferation efforts for the twenty - first century , recommitting the United States to being a leader in the fight to create a world without nuclear weapons .
The globalization of trade has opened up opportunity and lifted billions out of poverty around the world . Giant corporations have made money hand over fist . But our trade and economic policies have not delivered the same kind of benefits for America ' s middle class . In fact , U . S . trade policy has delivered one punch in the gut after another to workers and to the unions that fight for them .
Parents are so desperate to be reunited with their children that they may be trading in their legal right to asylum .
Even as we modernize our own military , we must set the conditions to stay competitive here at home by investing in science and technology , education , infrastructure , and other engines of economic and national security - and by asking those American companies who enjoy these benefits of America to pay their fair share to keep us strong . It means we take care of our returning service members with bipartisan work like the law Republican John Cornyn and I passed to make it easier for experienced , active military to get better paying jobs when they transition to civilian life . It means that as we pursue economic growth , we need to stand up for American workers , consumers , manufacturers , and small businesses . It means we should run a trade policy - including tariffs where necessary - that works for American workers , not just for multinational corporations . But it also means we must recognize that trade should serve our larger foreign policy goals , not the other way around .
Of course , my proposals today won ' t solve every problem we have with our big tech companies .
Those are each tough problems , but the benefit of taking these steps to promote competition is that it allows us to make some progress on each of these important issues too . More competition means more options for consumers and content creators , and more pressure on companies like Facebook to address the glaring problems with their businesses .
Meanwhile , multinational corporations exploited their enormous influence on both sides of the negotiating table to ensure that the terms of trade between nations always favored their own bottom lines . Time after time , American workers got the short end of the stick . Median household income in the United States stagnated for a generation , and policy - makers ' choices helped the elite but put workers at an even greater disadvantage : decimated unions , lower labor standards , rising costs of living . Job training and transition assistance proved powerless against the onslaught of offshoring , providing little more than burial insurance for workers who lost their jobs . And as capital became more mobile , corporations and wealthy individuals sent trillions of dollars to offshore tax havens , robbing the U . S . government of needed resources to reinvest at home in updated infrastructure and public education . By the time the 2008 global financial crash came around , it only confirmed what millions of Americans already knew : the system was rigged against working people .
We should also look at where our defense spending is actually counterproductive . For example , the President has threatened Russia with a nuclear arms race , saying we ' ll simply outspend our rivals . Boy , is that wrong . The United States has over 4 , 000 nuclear weapons in our active arsenal , and our conventional military might is overwhelming . Trump ' s nuclear arms race does not make us - or the world - any safer .
governments because they had conflicts of interest because they had financial problems that made them vulnerable and what does the President of the United States do instead of saying hey whoa my responsibility ' s watch out for the American people no these are friends these are people with money and with connections and the answer was just ran them on through you know the Trump administration is a walking talking living breathing threat to national
But rather than using this opportunity as leverage to hold our partners accountable , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rubber - stamped the Saudi - led coalition ' s actions . Secretary of Defense James Mattis asserted that the coalition was making " every effort " to prevent civilian casualties -- even as the United Nations reported that the coalition was responsible for the majority of the children killed in Yemen last year .
We can start by ensuring that workers are meaningfully represented at the negotiating table and build trade agreements that strengthen labor standards worldwide .
It is a threat because economic corruption knows no borders  ' and in a global economy , corruption can provide a strategic advantage .
Washington technocrats backed austerity , deregulation , and privatization around the world . As one crisis after another hit , the economic security of working people around the globe was destroyed , reducing public faith in both capitalism and democracy .
drink the sheep are saying I don ' t remember seeing the Lord and doing these things for the Lord when saw we thee stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these the least of my brethren ye have done it unto me and that for me it ' s what all of this is

Under the original Marshall Plan , America helped European countries rebuild after World War II because we knew it would benefit America ' s interests and provide a long - term return on our investments . We have a similar opportunity to exercise global leadership and serve our own interests today .
Donald Trump campaigned against that rigged system . But after two years in office , it is clear that his economic policies are beyond inept ; they are deliberately rigged in favor of his family and his wealthy friends . His renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement raises drug prices for consumers while doing little to stem the flow of good jobs going to other countries . His tariffs have hit farming communities hard and driven trading partners into the arms of U . S . competitors . And his conflicts of interest with corrupt foreign governments ' from expedited Chinese patent applications for his daughter Ivanka Trump to the millions in foreign money spent at the Trump family ' s Washington hotel ' raise obvious questions about who he is really working for . This president may have campaigned on a promise to put  ' America first ,  ' but his policies have put the Trump family first and middle - class American families last .
I wanted to come here today because there ' s a lot at stake  ' and it ' s your generation that will live with the consequences of the decisions being made today .

Take Afghanistan . We ' ve  ' turned the corner ' in Afghanistan so many times that we ' re now going in circles . Poppy production is up . The Taliban are on the rise . Afghan forces are taking unsustainable losses . The government is losing territory and credibility . On my trip to Afghanistan last year , I met American servicemembers who were young children on 9 / 11 . This isn ' t working .

The result is an extreme concentration of wealth not seen in any other leading economy . The 400 richest Americans currently own more wealth than all Black households and a quarter of Latino households combined . According to an analysis from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman from the University of California - Berkeley , the richest top 0 . 1 % has seen its share of American wealth nearly triple from 7 % to 20 % between the late 1970 s and 2016 , while the bottom 90 % has seen its share of wealth decline from 35 % to 25 % in that same period . Put another way , the richest 130 , 000 families in America now hold nearly as much wealth as the bottom 117 million families combined .
In China , President Xi consolidates his power and talks about the  ' China Dream ,  ' while state - owned and state - influenced corporations make millionaires out of friends and family of Communist party elites . Corruption .
The framers of our Constitution believed that the decision to involve ourselves in a conflict like the one in Yemen requires the consent of the people , expressed through their elected representatives . But Congress has never authorized our involvement in this conflict . That ' s why we have supported bicameral , bipartisan efforts to end the US involvement in Yemen ' s civil war unless Congress specifically authorizes it .
