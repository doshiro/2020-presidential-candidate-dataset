for our unions let us remember that we Democrats come from a great stock when the Russians beat us to Sputnik and the air was Sputnik we didn ' t tear each other apart we joined together with hidden figures together with white astronauts and we went to the moon we come from Kennedy who pointed to the moon King who pointed to a mountaintop and said we will rise we when they pushed us back in Selma and they tried to stop it as in Stonewall we said we
for generations and generations in this nation and that means we go back to the beginning and we need to acknowledge that the very founding of our country was an act of profound contradiction those who sought the most profound and glorious freedom in so many ways for so many people also perpetuated the very opposite bigotry was written into our founding documents Native Americans in our Declaration of Independence referred to as savages in our Constitution black
freedom fighters we must know now struggle to put more indivisible back into our one nation under God we must be freedom fighters we now must label to do the difficult labor to do the difficult we must be freedom fighters we must stand together and walk together and struggle together for a new American freedom in our generation freedom from fear freedom from violence freedom from hatred freedom to seek freedom to prosper freedom to dream America anew
You know , protest is good , and I ' ve been encouraging people there be a lot of protests at the Mall and cities all across America protesting this really - these morally despicable actions by the Trump administration separating folks from families . But this is also a time , I believe , as Americans who seek to create a beloved community , who believe in a more what I consider a radical love , love thy neighbor - no exceptions . And whether that person is coming over the border or whether that person is somebody who votes differently than you , we ' ve got to be a nation that treats each other with our highest ideals .
and hopefully reflected in the people we elect our highest offices on the last question yes sir I don ' t know the I don ' t know the I don ' t know the heart of anybody I ' ll leave that to the Lord I know there are a lot of people who profess the ideology of white supremacy that use his words and I believe his failure to condemn bigotry and racism I believe that when he makes comments about African countries when he
veterans homelessness veterans deserve everything they fought so bravely for health care education and good - paying jobs the only way we build a nation of liberty and justice for all is by doing it together we have to decide whether we will choose division and blame or if we will do the hard work of conquering fear with faith apathy with action and hatred
through apathy and indifference to the violence that threatens to tear us asunder that is the challenge of our generation today it is the collective crossroads we are at people ' s very lives are in the balance and to be frank the future of our country hangs in the balance the character and the culture of who we are hangs in the balance this is the crossroads which is why we can ' t let these conversations devolve into the impotent simplicity of who is or isn ' t a
and we will build in our country starting with the highest office in the land and all across our nation we will build a culture where men respect women where sexual assault and harassment are no longer swept under the rug and future generations don ' t have to raise their hand to say me too we won ' t wait any longer for equal justice under the law we will pass the Equality Act and ensure that LGBTQ Americans are protected under federal civil rights law we will pursue
without the crutch of allusions or covering over the pain or the wretchedness and instead tell a story of the greatness of a country and who we can be together who we have been in overcoming this because America has shown greatness not because of the absence of violent bigotry and white supremacy but because of our efforts together to overcome it in truth ours is the story of the faith we have had in one another how we have
past to publicize the costs on society and privatize their profits now everything I just mentioned was going on before Donald Trump was elected we have to be serious about what ' s happening I ' m traveling all over the country now and I see from Iowa to South Carolina that it ' s not just about who ' s president state legislators legislators are attacking public education straight legislators like we see are attacking the right to organize and States this
looking forward to answer your questions but for me I ' m not running for president because of an office or position for me life is always about purpose and not position I got into politics as a central Ward councilman because of communities like mine too many people being left out too many people being left aside we must be about the purpose of this nation the dream of this country I am fighting to run for president because I think we can reignite that
face of the earth I would be no better or worse off because I was just tolerating you and your difference like I tolerate a cold or a headache we are not called to tolerate injustice we are called to combat it we are not called to tolerate each other we are called to love one another so we must acknowledge as a country that as much as white supremacy manifests manifests itself in dangerous and deadly acts of terror it is perpetrated by what is too often a
here in Newark down in Camden kids are drinking out of bottled water because of the lead in their pipes we have a nation where there ' s hundreds of places where it seems to be easier to find unleaded gasoline than unleaded water and a lot of this is not about pointing fingers we all have to start taking responsibility because it seems like we ' re more eager to do something but like giving tax cuts to corporations that weren ' t even asking for the level of tax cuts we gave as
a new Voting Rights Act and gerrymandering and get the dark money out of politics once and for all and unlike this president I won ' t ignore or give license to white supremacy I will put more resources towards protecting our country from it and we will no longer wait for America to stand up for justice around the world we will strengthen our alliances and defend
will close the racial wealth gap in America because we can ' t be blind to the impact of generations of racism and white supremacy that were written into our laws over centuries that ' s why we will create a federally funded savings account for every child born in America that starts at birth and as they grow up it ' ll give the lowest income kids in our country up to $ 50 , 000 to pay for college put a down payment on a home or jump start a small business we won ' t wait to
sense of moral urgency our impatience comes from the most demanding of all values it comes from love love of our families love of our communities love of our country and love of each other you know the mayor was right Newark brick city this community this community taught me all about that love it ' s not that feel - good easygoing love it is strong courageous love it is defiant love the kind of love that works
and Alice Paul who loved this country so much she was willing to demand that it live up to its promise she was the first person ever arrested in front of the White House because she refused to let people in power undermine the power of the people the rights of women the people I admire are the people that Levi ' s calling out the best of who we are not the worst so I ' m running for president because I believe in us I believe in these values
We cannot descend into a kind of hatred that really undermines what I think is beautiful about this nation , hopeful about this nation . And so I think that ' s just civility . I remember hugging John McCain when he came back to the floor after a cancer diagnosis and getting pilloried by people in my own party for doing that . We ' ve got to get our country back to a place where we respect each other , no matter what our beliefs are .
let anybody tell you otherwise it ' s not about left or right it is about right or wrong it is about the character of our country and we as Democrats now we have to understand that the objective we have yeah we want to win elections we want to send Mitch McConnell to the backbench we want to get a new president but we ' re not running on the short - term political goal of beating Republicans we must run on the larger goal of uniting Americans again because we ' re a nation where we
As the Ranking Member of the Africa Subcommittee on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , I have had a chance to see first hand the U . S .- Africa relationship ' s importance to our future . Africa is the epicenter of the youth bulge - its population is projected to double by 2050 , and already , almost 70 percent of the population is under the age of 30 . The U . S . has an interest in a stable , prosperous Africa that is able to meet its governance goals with an economic environment that attracts U . S . companies and creates the good jobs that are needed for the millions of young Africans who will enter the workforce every year . We need to allocate more resources at the State Department and USAID to focus on Africa and develop and execute strategies to reduce poverty , improve quality of life , and strengthen democratic institutions .
we will achieve things that other people say are impossible I believe we will make justice real for all people and that is why I am running for president of the United States of America and let me tell you let me tell you and let me tell you we are a great nation because of all our people into the people across the country who don ' t speak English as their
difference in this neighborhood I ' ve long since believed that life is about purpose and not position and I started to stay true to the purpose that brought me into politics in the first place it ' s why if you ' re in my office in Washington it ' s a map of this neighborhood that sits behind me in my desk to focus on the folks who first took a chance on me and put me into the game and what my neighbors are concerned with and I ' ve heard all around the country is that
Well , I got in last night around midnight and went straight to the border and crossed into Mexico and then walked back with a few of my staff members to encounter Customs and Border Patrol in the field to see the process for legal immigration , where people come to this country seeking asylum escaping , you know , oppression and other challenges and what they would encounter . And there have been allegations made to me and others that Customs and Border Patrol are pushing people away and not even letting - allowing them to present themselves for asylum .
will rise with Donald Trump in the White House he may try to tear us down but in this next election we will rise and I ' ll tell you this to end with the great words of a poet Donald Trump may try to demean and degrade and divide but we will answer him with the hearts and our spirits and our courage and grit and love and as that poet said he may try to write us down in history with his bitter twisted lies he may try to trot us down in the very dirt but America like dust
The Trump foreign policy team has made clear that it does not think it must abide by any of these rules , and the new commitment announced by Secretary Tillerson shows that it is ready to break them . Clearly and lamentably , the president is prepared to flout constitutional limits on his authority to commit our troops on his own .
truth there can be no reconciliation James Baldwin wrote in the fire next time that it is the innocence which constitutes the crime silence in the face of these in justices is a choice to be passive is to be complicit to ignore hate is to empower it it is to fall back on that easy false virtue of tolerance to probably claim that we are a nation of tolerance is no great aspiration tolerance suggests that if you disappear off the
us we fight because we know that we are all in this together that our founders as imperfect as they were ended the Declaration of Independence with a declaration of interdependence they said that we must if we ' re going to make it as a nation mutually pledge pledge to each other Our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred honor we fight to revive those ideals in our country at a time that someone is torching them but let me tell you I don ' t care how many
To be sure , any course of action in Syria risks dire and deadly consequences . Nearly half a million people have died since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war . The horrors of the violence there defy description , and the role and intent of Russian and Iranian forces backing Mr . Assad remain of deep concern .
but this is not a political moment I ' m not here today to ask for a vote I ' m here today to ask if we again as a nation have the collective resolve to change the reality we live in I ' m here today to ask if we have it in ourselves to tell a renewed new story an honest story about our nation because we know the truth will set us free we know that these are not problems that will just go away inevitably this is a hard and painful and difficult work it will take
weaponizing hatred can be effective it often seems easy Islamophobia anti - semitism homophobia xenophobia misogyny these tactics aren ' t a new perversion of our politics they ' ve been ingrained and our politics since our founding generations of politicians have used fear of the other for political gain and that is certainly the case today hate crimes in America are increasing anti - semitism and Islamophobia are on
While I strongly support a nuclear deal with Iran , we cannot turn back the clock and pretend the damage that President Trump has caused over the last 3 years hasn ' t happened . The 2015 deal was premised on continued negotiations with the Iranians so that we could work towards a longer - term solution . We will have had four years wasted under Trump , and the sunset clauses , after which key provisions will phase out , are now that much closer . We must take stock of facts on the ground , including Iran ' s recent breach of its enrichment limit , and negotiate an updated agreement to stop the threat posed by Iran ' s nuclear program .
education I ' m gonna go to the person in the back jumping up and down oh yeah it ' s one how you doing man I can ' t see you underneath all that hat egde well first of all I just want everybody to know I miss Obama and I miss her husband too look I I had I ' ve had conversations with Obama in the past god bless him and and and I ' m really grateful for the kind of leadership he provided this country I got to in fact but first one of the
up in solidarity behind them and when we win that office fact that office holder must lead the greatest grassroots organizing efforts we ever seen to secure in this nation again a country where public education is fully funded to secure in this nation where we have a criminal justice system that is not known for jailing the mentally ill jailing the addicted jailing the poor but is about restorative justice about empowering people we ' ve got to return to
struggling and hurting look I ' m the only senator who comes home to a low - income inner - city beautiful community and and I know and you know that we don ' t have the privilege to wait for what fits into someone else ' s narrow view of what it means to be a progressive our first priority must be to make people ' s lives better right now to move the ball forward how best we can as fast as we can and to ensure that the closest that those folks
again once and for all let us be the land of the free there is only one way to get there and that ' s together only one way to win with the power the healing and the salvation we find in love let us proclaim that we can be a nation in our generator to sing the songs of our answers to proclaim that we are going to be the generation that truly will be free at last thank you for having me here god bless you and God bless america
the land of the free and I with working with others pass the first bill that finally takes a real crack and ending mass incarceration even something I realized that capital in this country is lazy doesn ' t invest in fact about five cities have the overwhelming majority of investment capital going there I passed I wrote legislation with a Republican across the aisle that now is law and is going to get hundreds of billions of dollars finally invested
tell you tonight there are a lot of candidates in this race but I want to tell you that I am running not just because I stand with my colleagues on believing that health care should be a right I stand with my colleagues and understanding that we have to meet the existential crisis of climate change I stand with my colleagues and know that a system of mass incarceration and a nation that professes freedom is obscene and objectively wrong
love Victoria I ' m sorry about that I ' m sorry but this is really important I ' m going to run the boldest probe public school teacher campaign there is because well how I how I governed when I was mayor of the City of Newark we fought to get PE teachers here in the city increased pay increased respect better access to technology and by the way when we talk about schools let ' s not just talk about being there for teachers but also for councilors our schools do not
The killing of Jamal Khashoggi was a stark reminder of the human rights violations perpetuated by the highest levels of leadership in Saudi Arabia . Despite the international condemnation for the murder of Khashoggi , the most senior officials implicated remain free , and the Saudi government has doubled down on its repressive tactics . The Saudi - led coalition ' s indiscriminate bombing and unlawful blockading of essential goods to Yemen ' s civilian population has created a humanitarian disaster . Despite this record and repeated opposition from Congress , the Trump Administration continues to sell weapons to the Saudis that can be used in Yemen against innocent civilians .
people try to tear us down or history speaks that we are a nation that has always responded by coming together and rising up and now it ' s time again that is that moment in history again that we must join together in a chorus and say we will rise we will rise for health care for all we will rise for public schools and public education we will rise for the mentally ill and the homeless we will rise for economic justice we will rise
s Tim Kaine , a Virginia Democrat , and Jeff Flake , an Arizona Republican , have worked for years to draw attention to the absence of legal authorization for military operations in the Middle East . And Bob Corker of Tennessee , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , made clear at a recent committee hearing that if the United States were to remain in Syria to fight Iranian proxies ,  ' the authorizations are not there for that kind of activity .  '
challenges and demeans the ability of a federal judge to do their job because of their ancestry that ' s bigoted language and there ' s no way around that but I just want everybody to know I ' m I ' m I ' m gonna run a race about not who I ' m against or what I ' m against both but who I ' m for and what I ' m for I ' m not looking even to too simplistically to beat Republicans no I ' m looking to unite Americans in this race because I believe we have more in
be the last question and I ' m sorry and then I ' ll go up but this is really important bringing people together means we should be uncompromising and talking about justice and holding people accountable I really worry that right now we have a country that has such appalling levels of injustice right now there are over a thousand jurisdictions in America where kids have more than twice the blood lead levels than Flint Michigan
the common cause and singular destiny of this nation a radical love that rejects the sinister and dangerous delusion of other Ness a delusion that divides that weakens that pits American against American to our own collective peril the kind of love this kind of love is a love that demands honesty because we all know in both our public and our private lives that real love demands the truth it requires us to admit when we are wrong to be vulnerable about our mistakes and
story never more so than in times of transition and times of rapid social change we have seen it from the Civil War to the civil rights movement from the web summer of a hundred years ago to Charlottesville from the lynching of people of Mexican descent in Porvenir Tech 101 years ago to the massacre targeting Latin X people in El Paso Texas this past Saturday to say this is to speak the truth plainly because without the
community rebuilt here on this hallowed soil with faith in God and in one another when black churches were outlaws this community this church met in secret for decades with faith in God and in one another and when evil showed itself in this church basement four years ago this church again showed that the faith he showed what faith in actions look like and when nine souls were taken Reverend clementa pinckney Reverend Shonda Coleman singleton Cynthia Hurd Susie
hatred we witnessed this past weekend did not start with the hand that pulled the trigger it did not begin when a single white supremacist got into his car to travel ten hours to kill as many human beings as he could it was planted in fertile soil because the contradictions that have shadowed this country since its founding remain a part of our body politic it was sowed by those who spoke the same words the el paso murderer did
people in America are losing faith that this nation will work for them they ' re beginning to believe that that too many folks are going to get left out or left behind they beginning to believe that the forces that are tearing us apart are stronger than the forces that bond us together as a people as a country I ' m running for president because I want to address these issues we are a nation the story of who we are everybody who ' s gathered on my front
stores our bars our temples and our churches and our schools by banning assault weapons once and for all and and look this is common sense we ' ve done it for cars we can do it for guns we must require federal licensing for guns in America it is a common - sense policy and one that we know from the evidence and the data will actually save lives and we ' ve got to go further we must require that the Department of Justice Homeland Security and the FBI
the really tough challenges is by extending grace finding common ground and working together and we know this that today so many of us are hurting so many of us are understandably angry so many of us are feeling afraid for our futures and our families too many people believe the force is tearing us apart are stronger than the bonds that hold us together well I don ' t believe that I believe we will bring our country together I believe
are Americans women must have the freedom to make decisions about their own bodies and economic futures as your president I will aport appoint Supreme Court justices who will defend roe v wade and we will take on the systemic challenges that disproportionately affect women and hold back our entire country we will fight for equal pay affordable child care and finally establish a national paid family and medical leave program for our country
even agree on things 90 % of Americans agree on common - sense gun safety regulation but we don ' t even get the things done we agree on this is a moral moment because here we are in America who were the first generation of our life expectancy going down where we say we love our children but every other competitor global industrialized nation has universal prenatal care but we lead with infant mortality maternal mortality that we say we ' re the home of the brave
Yes , the United States has a role to play in holding Mr . Assad accountable for the crimes he has committed against his own people and preventing him from committing more . But the president doesn ' t have the power to unilaterally make the decision to commit American troops to stop Mr . Assad by force . He needs to make his case to Congress and the American people , as well as the international community . Inserting American troops into this situation on his own is not just bad policy , it is illegal under both the Constitution and international law .
schools your chances of going to a high - performing school that beats the suburbs one of three hundred percent and perhaps the best thing to say to anybody who wants to criticize my leadership in Newark when I left Newark for the first time in 60 years our population was growing again people were moving here because of our schools moving here because of our arts and entertainment moving here because they weren ' t interested in tearing down this city
If the constitutional violations weren ' t troubling enough , the announced plan would also put the United States in direct violation of international law . The American operations against the Islamic State and Qaeda elements in Syria were made in the defense of the United States and its allies , particularly Iraq . This was the basis for the American explanation to the United Nations of its military operations in Syria , provided by Ambassador Samantha Power on Sept . 23 , 2014 . That explanation was reiterated in a letter to Congress from Secretary Tillerson last fall .
buy fresh fruits and vegetables we open grocery stores in food deserts we got people to invest here we open new businesses here we created thousands of jobs here together and after 60 years of decline after 60 years of the cly look around you newark is growing again and New Jersey when you sent me to Washington as your senator I brought those lessons with me politics in DC are
the hat behind the TMZ camera cuz I am literally not not looking forward to him and asking me a question go ahead well first and foremost our teachers are ridiculously underpaid in America if you just want to look at this in an economic analysis they are the profession that contributes the most to a thriving American economy and we can not continue to devalue what is one of the greatest professions in our country which is public schoolteachers hermana ha ha ha I
with love but we know the challenges we know that there are forces at work at home and abroad trying to get us to fight the wrong way and on their terms from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the Kremlin we know what their strategy is it ' s to pit us against each other for their own gain to make us suspicious of one another to make us fear each other
ensure that every child can drink the water from their sink and breathe the air in their neighborhood without getting sick we won ' t wait for inclusive criminal excuse me for inclusive economic justice we will fight against the onslaught of attacks on workers rights in America you see it was my grandfather ' s Union job that helped my mom and my family move from poverty into the middle class and we will protect that pathway for workers who are now
Nicolas Maduro lacks the legitimacy to govern , and I have publicly stated that he should step down for the good of his people . However , we cannot simply anoint a new Venezuelan government -- that would be repeating the mistakes of our dark history in the region .
dream again bigger than any individual and that ' s where I want to end I want to challenge everyone and I ' m excited about answering your questions but we are next week under to get the 51 st anniversary of this slot of the murder of Martin Luther King in Memphis and if you go there to Memphis Tennessee and you look down right there at the MER Lorraine Motel you are gonna see words from Scripture that are a challenge to future generations they ' re the words that
the rise the majority of terrorist attacks in this country since 9 / 11 have been perpetrated by right - wing extremists here at home and the majority of those have been white supremacists and these acts of hatred do not happen in a vacuum they are harvested only once they have been planted Galatians reads do not be deceived God is not mocked for whatever a man shows this he will also reap you reap what you sow the ant act of anti - latino anti - immigrant
racist because of the answer to the question to racism and white supremacy exist is yes then the real question isn ' t who is or isn ' t a racist but who is and isn ' t doing something about it this is a question that has a deep moral resonance it ' s not enough to say I ' m not a racist we must be anti racism because there ' s no neutrality in this fight you are either an agent of justice or you are contributing to the problem addressing this and we must understand
so we can ' t allow them to divide us and we must also resist the urge to divide ourselves because the people on my block the people gathered here and folks all across the country can ' t wait they can ' t afford a politics of division that sacrifices progress for purity they can ' t afford to allow this election to become just an exercise and political posturing or box checking competition that is completely divorced from the realities of so many people who are
Protecting human rights must be a central tenet of our foreign policy and that means protecting persecuted religious and ethnic minorities and preventing genocides . If I am president , whenever the United States meets with China , human rights will be a focus of the conversation .
defeated Bull Connor and brought down segregation in their City America America we know our history it is a perpetual testimony to impatient demanding unrelenting people in every generation with love stood up for justice generations of Americans have shown us what was possible when they refused to wait and now it is our turn and we have work to do America we can ' t wait America we will not wait
dad ' s quality of care from these incredible professionals was already great but it got a little greater my dad then died six days before I was elected to the United States Senate Harry was one of those early calls to me when I got to the Senate there were two people I saw before I stood before Joe Biden to be sworn in on the floor of the United States Senate and the first my mom took me because she knew the void in my heart that my dad was gone but she
Some critics have said this use of the self - defense exception is overbroad . But even if that argument was plausible before , the indefinite commitment of United States troops to hold territory in Syria cannot be defended on similar grounds .
we found our common ground now this is not easy it ' s a tough work of building a great community or what King called the Beloved Community it ' s hard to do that but it ' s about time we get to the hard work of building this nation to be who we want us to be our best values our best ideals the best of who we are we need leadership in this country that understands what patriotism means and patriotism is love of country and you can ' t love your country unless
It makes sense . But this goes back to I think some of the larger issues that we as a country are dealing with . And the president seems to - who has been the architect of this crisis with his separating families and many of the tactics he ' s taking on that violate our values . We are a planet right now where there ' s dozens of countries facing immigration challenges from Lebanon , where a quarter of their population right now is immigrants , to Canada .
into the lowest income areas creating many many jobs so I know I can do my job as a senator I ' ve been showing that and I also know that I can answer the call what I believe my country is right now which is leadership that ' s gonna bring us together and not try to rip us apart well well I ' m grateful that New Jerseyans pulled together to make sure that that that possibility is there but my focus is running for president in the
Yet even though the consequences of bringing American troops home after the defeat of the Islamic State in Syria are uncertain , far more dangerous are the consequences of remaining indefinitely .
corrosive it hurts the very people it actually even claims to represent think about this that white supremacy allows political leaders to promise to build the wall while not building hospitals schools or infrastructure critical for the success of all Americans it talks about the invasion of immigrants while allowing the deadly opioids to invade our communities kill our children lower the life expectancy of Americans and white men in particular and it creates a
When it comes to Russian aggression , let ' s be clear : the Russians are not just attacking Ukraine , or the U . S .-- they are trying to undermine democracy . They are attempting to create divisions and divisiveness between individual leaders as well as within nations , and that ' s unacceptable . The Trump Administration has looked the other way in the face of Russian aggression , whether that aggression is against Ukraine , which I visited and witnessed first - hand , or an attack on the integrity of our elections .
option I will use the government government ' s bargaining power to once and for all bring down the cost of prescription drugs and I will once and for all end the sabotage of the Affordable Care Act we won ' t wait to fix our broken immigration system because in America immigration is and always has been a source of strength we will pass comprehensive immigration reform we will create a pathway to
that are closest to the pain and closest to the struggle have an active hand in defining how we confronted a real progressive movement refuses to stall out in righteous indignation it channels that indignation into the work that actually improves people ' s lives a real progressive movement does not hold progress for communities like mine hostage today for promises that perfection will come tomorrow we are the inheritors of those kind of movements
we must actively affirm or love in the face of this rising hate of our day we must now dedicate ourselves as our ancestors did to being freedom fighters for liberty is one of the most sacred of all of our civic values we must be freedom fighters we must dedicate ourselves to freedom again now we in this generation that freedom fight that is our national tests those who peddle hate at home and abroad those who seek to pit us against each other we must be

old stockbroker pays less than a percentage of their income in taxes or gets better tax breaks than a 50 year old teacher who reaches in their pocket to pay for food or or sanitary products or clothing for their kids we need to start having a tax code in this country that reflects our values as a people everybody understands that we can ' t be a leading nation without leading the world in education we need to get back to that public
