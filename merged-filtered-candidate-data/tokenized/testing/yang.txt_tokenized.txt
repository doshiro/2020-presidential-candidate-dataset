Incentivize content production of high - quality and positive kids programming similar to broadcast TV .
In order to directly tackle this issue , however , we need to start by establishing a census - like team that will research and find all of our homeless veterans and get them and their information into the VA system . This will allow the health professionals to treat any mental or physical health issues that are contributing to the homelessness , as well as enroll them in other programs to help with employment , financial literacy , and general life skills .
Reforming Individuals Trying to Leave Hate
Algorithms driving recommendations towards conspiracy theory content or other types of disinformation need to be reined in . Same goes for bots , which have exacerbated the situation .
Lower Voting Age to 16
Finally , government needs to be forward - thinking and informed on the latest technological developments , so that new regulations can keep up with innovation . We shouldn ' t stifle innovation , but we also shouldn ' t let it outpace our ability to regulate it .
Beyond removing our machines from the internet , we will build a system in which every vote leaves a paper trail . Paper backups are critical in cases of hardware failure and guarantee that a vote won ' t be lost on account of a software bug . Additionally , paper provides a record of the vote that can ' t be hacked or easily altered . Optical scanners that read paper ballots and store them electronically are a great way to combine the security of paper with the ease of technology .
We can and should apply more regulations to political financing , including repealing Citizens United , but we must also recognize that no matter what we do , money will try to find its way back in . Since we cannot totally eliminate the role of money in politics , we have to be creative in diminishing the influence that wealthy donors and corporations have on campaigns .
I don ' t want to prescribe the specifics of a two - state solution , as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation , and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders to come up with confidence - building measures , such as a ceasefire and an end to the expansion of settlements , as we look towards building a sustainable peace . Coming together to provide aid to those suffering in Gaza can also be an opportunity for all parties to work together to handle a humanitarian crisis that is causing untold suffering .
Increase the budget for fighting domestic terrorism to match non - military spending on fighting foreign terrorism .
Big Tech companies are the winners of the 21 st century economy . They ' ve amassed too much power , largely profiting from our personal data , and unaccountable responsibility ' we have reached a point where the government needs to step in . And we ' re starting to take notice , with about 50 % of US adults 1 favoring more regulation on tech firms . These companies themselves are asking for regulation ( until you propose specifics ).
we need it more than ever but there is no way that I Andrew yang can make this happen without your help so when I was with Michael Tubbs in Stockton California we ' re talking about universal basic income we had a panels a smaller group than this and then he said to me something he put his arm around me and said Andrew you can say things that I cannot and get away with it and I looked at him I said thank you but you can say things I cannot and get away with in the
Our service members live a life much different than the rest of us during their service . This experience can make the transition to civilian life difficult . All members of the military should receive training as they end their service that makes this transition as smooth as possible .
People with disabilities face basic physical barriers in accessibility to the polls . Simple barriers like stairs can make it so that many voting - eligible people can ' t make it to the polls . In the actual voting booth , a lack of assistive technology can make it impossible for some PWD to accurately cast their ballot . Implementing advanced technology would make the voting process more efficient and accessible to people with disabilities . All polling locations need to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and should be vetted for accessibility issues before each election . Vote by mail initiatives can also play a huge role in ensuring PWD have access to casting their vote .
Safe elections require more than responsible machines , they require responsible humans . My administration will work with states and voting staff to guarantee they are trained in best cybersecurity practices , including threat detection and reporting . By bringing together the best that humans and technology have to offer , we can ensure every American has access to a secure ballot box .
We need to bring the full force of America to bear on this problem , or we will fail , and the world will suffer . My approach is five - pronged :
Why have we so far barely made a dent in what we need to do in order to combat this crisis ? When 78 % of our fellow Americans are living paycheck to paycheck , it ' s hard to mobilize people to care about the massive problem of climate change . Many think ,  ' I can ' t pay my bills . The penguins will have to wait .  ' It ' s impossible to think about the future if you can ' t feed your kids today . We need to get the economic boot off of the throats of our fellow Americans so everyone can get their heads up and start facing this threat head - on .
job to start a non - profit after the financial crisis I saw what we did we had a choice between the banks and our people who are losing their homes and we chose the banks and I said that was the wrong choice this time we ' re going to choose our people way forward and I want to walk you through because some of you are here you ' re getting curious you ' re like who it ' s guys interesting can he win oh I can win

We must absolutely and unequivocally condemn white nationalism as an ideology . We must absolutely and unequivocally condemn any violence done in furtherance of this ideology . We must harshly punish anyone who commits a crime in order to accomplish the goals of this ideology . A single life lost as a result of domestic terrorism is too many .
We need to confront this threat head - on . In order to tackle the massive problems we face  ' climate change , economic displacement , growing authoritarianism across the globe  ' all Americans must be united . There ' s no room for hateful and extremist ideologies in this country . It ' s time that we get serious about confronting this threat .
We can also improve our school system . First , we can expand it to provide affordable childcare and early childhood education / universal pre - K for all students , to improve educational outcomes and socialization . Second , we can ensure that every school has staff trained to identify children in crisis , so that the issues they ' re dealing with can be identified . Finally , schools should be encouraged , through grants , to investigate alternative disciplinary plans that focus on positively reinforcing good behavior instead of punishing bad behavior . These programs have shown great promise in many schools that have implemented them .
Let ' s come together to address this challenge .
Iran is a destabilizing force in the region , and the JCPOA gave us both short - term victories in stabilizing the region through minimizing their influence , and inroads to further discussion to find a solution that would work over a longer period . Leaving the JCPOA was a massive strategic mistake , and one that only served to increase the likelihood of armed conflict in the country . The American people have no desire for armed conflict with Iran , which would lead to another multi - decade engagement that would spread throughout the region and have no clear benefit for the American people .
In the context of voting , user interface is a matter of national importance . Old machines reduce the number of voters who actually finalize their vote , because confusing instructions frustrate them , and voters leave before their vote can be recorded . These machines also lack the critical security measures that protect votes from hacking and manipulation .
The United States should serve as a partner to the African nations . We should be driven by the motto  ' African solutions for African problems .  ' We should facilitate American entrepreneurs to partner with African entrepreneurs in technology - especially energy , agriculture , civil society , and beyond . We need to ensure that the African nations view the United States as an ally and model . We can also learn a lot from the continent , as they ' re adopting technologies that aren ' t in widespread use in the US and we can see their impact and push to adopt the ones that have the largest benefits .
While Maduro ' s actions of undermining democracy are inexcusable , we should not get embroiled in military action to remove him from power . The United States must push with our allies for Maduro to step down , through diplomacy , and through sanctions targeted at Maduro and his supporters . We must also work with Guaido , and with him consider amnesty for some of Maduro ' s military support to entice them to support Guaido as President of the National Assembly and interim President .

GI Bill / Education Improvements
Free of the bias of private industry or think tanks , the OTA provided neutral information on the latest technological developments to legislators . Many of these reports , despite being a quarter of a century old , show an amazing prescience on topics that are still relevant to this day . This vital institution needs to be revived , with a budget large enough and rules flexible enough to draw top talent away from the very lucrative private sector , and with the mandate to ensure that our legislators are up to the task of regulating the biggest technological issues of our time .
8 . What , if any , additional steps should the United States take to remove Nicol ' s Maduro from power in Venezuela ?
Climate change , while a threat , is also a massive opportunity for the United States to regain its position as an innovator while relocating the energy sector within our borders . By providing grants , investments , and tax incentives , we can develop clean energy and carbon capture technologies , and then help the rest of the world get their energy from clean , American - made sources . The whole world should be using US solar panels , turbines , and other renewable technologies .
Establish procedures that allow wrongly removed voters to vote on Election Day .
Work with social media and hosting companies to minimize the spread of incitements to violence , while respecting First Amendment rights .
Additionally , it ' s high time we created a Department of Technology at the Cabinet level . Technological innovation shouldn ' t be stopped , but it should be monitored and analyzed to make sure we don ' t move past a point of no return . This will require cooperation between government and private industry to ensure that developing technologies can continue to improve our lives while keeping our data safe and ensuring our autonomy .
We also need to invest in , and create , mentorship programs for veterans . Non - profits such as American Corporate Partners are doing great work at matching veterans with mentors who can help them find and adapt to a new career . We should invest in other non - profits , and create programs within the federal government , that also help veterans adjust to civilian life . And we should also incentivize businesses to create mentorship programs internally , that provide both a non - veteran and veteran mentor to newly hired veterans . These mentors could help veterans in their careers , and also advocate internally for veteran candidates to be hired .
As President , I will '
China obviously has great ambition , and their system of government is becoming increasingly authoritarian as they develop more technologies that allow them to monitor and control their population . It ' s important that we work with our allies to combat the spread of this authoritarian capitalism , and provide a model for democratic capitalism .
Establish a victim ' s fund to help victim ' s of this violence recover .
As President , I will '
Since the U . S . Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act , polling stations have been vanishing , especially in locations with high populations of minorities . In a city in Alabama , council members eliminated 60 % of the polling locations within the nearby African American district , but left open 100 % of the polls in the white - majority districts . 19 Fewer polling stations substantially decreases voter turnout , 20 and drastically increases long lines at the polling stations . In addition , last - minute changes to polling stations force voters to figure out where their new polling stations are and rearrange their transportation plans or schedules accordingly . These abrupt changes limit access to polling stations and deter Americans from showing up .
Israel has been an important ally to the US , and it will continue to be an important ally . It is a democracy in a region where that is rare . I disagree with some of the policies of the current Israeli administration , but I believe the relationship is fundamentally strong and will continue to be .

Include classes on the responsible use of technology in public school curricula and teach children how to distinguish reliable from unreliable news sources online .
We need to work with our allies that are still party to the agreement to negotiate a new JCPOA , with longer terms and delayed deadlines to reflect the time wasted with Trump and Bolton ' s posturing . We need to get Iran back in compliance with the limitations placed on them under the agreement on nuclear materials and enrichment capabilities .
Schools should also be pushed to give unlimited course credit for equivalent courses from military training , especially for all service members who received additional training in specialized fields . The VA should work with all schools to create an  ' Equivalent Courses ' list so it ' s easy for veterans to figure out what they ' re qualified to receive credit for .
As President , I will :
There are certainly times when parts of a tech company should be divested based on traditional metrics , but other metrics beyond size and consumer impact ' such as data assets , vertical integration , or lack of new business formation ' should be considered as well .

We need to make sure China isn ' t stealing our IP or exporting their authoritarianism to other countries , and we must ensure that we have reliable access to rare earth metals . But the current trade war is just hurting both sides . An ascendant China isn ' t a direct threat to the United States , as long as we are strong at home and project that confidence to developing nations , to show them a superior path to the one China is offering .

Build a sustainable economy by transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy , upgrading our infrastructure , and improving the way we farm and use land . Public financing options will allow individuals to make the right decisions for their families .
Two recent examples that highlight the problems : cryptocurrencies , and video game loot boxes . Both are areas that many legislators are blind to , or completely unprepared to understand the technical aspects of . This is creating an unregulated marketplace in both areas . The lack of regulation is having disparate impacts :
The only acceptable end to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict involves a two - state solution that allows both the Israeli and Palestinian people to have sovereign land and self - determination .

Provide guidance ( and regulation , if needed ) on design features that maximize screen time for young people , like removing autoplay video for children under 16 , removing the queues that allow infinite scrolling , capping the number of recommendations per day , reducing notification signs and  ' like ' counts , and using artificial intelligence and machine learning to determine when children are using devices to cap screen hours per day .
And they ' re blending in better  ' having traded in their  ' boots for suits ,  ' there has been a concerted effort by these white nationalist groups to improve their image , seem more respectable , get degrees , and work in law enforcement , media , and other places where they can spread their hateful ideologies to a wider audience .

Provide tax incentives for gun safety purchases .
In addition to funding the operations of veteran healthcare , we need to ensure that we ' re creating a budget that allows for proper research into issues that affect the veteran community in particular . Suicide prevention and PTSD / TBI treatment , long - term effects of battlefield - related injuries , exposure to substances unique to combat environments , and similar areas should be researched to find the optimal treatments , and the VA ( in partnership with the CDC ) is best equipped to do so .

As we focus on the elections of today , we must not fail to prepare for those of tomorrow . The threat of cyber attacks is always growing and evolving , so we must keep up to date on every development to maintain secure election infrastructure .
Additionally , because of election cycles , there ' s a level of unfairness that comes with what year a person is born . Senators are on a 6 - year cycle , and the president is on a 4 - year cycle , not to mention local offices . Someone born at the wrong time in a cycle would have to wait much longer to cast a ballot for certain offices than someone born at another time . While that ' s true if the voting age is lowered to 16 , it decreases the age at which the person is first allowed to vote for that office , thus allowing them to have a longer period of their life where they feel represented .

Minimize health impacts of modern tech on our people , particularly our children . I will create a Department of the Attention Economy that focuses on smartphones , social media , gaming , and apps , and how to responsibly design and use them , including age restrictions and guidelines .
Hold future administrations accountable . We need to pass a constitutional amendment that creates a duty on the federal and state governments to be stewards for the environment .

We can also do more to increase the availability of affordable housing options . A great example of this is the Tiny Houses project by the Veterans Community Project . Non - profits and the government can work together to innovate in this space and ensure that no veteran falls through the cracks .
Every American should know that their vote matters . We must ensure that every American realizes the power of their vote and implement policies to change attitudes around voting , including ranked - choice voting , Democracy Dollars , and ending partisan gerrymandering .
First off , the United States should be providing no aid to Saudi Arabia in its assault on Yemen . It ' s creating a humanitarian crisis that ranks amongst the worst of all time . We should end all support for this situation - logistics , arms sales , refueling efforts , intelligence .

every American adult would receive $ 1 , 000 free and clear no questions asked every month to pay your bills invest in your families start new businesses and do what you want to do because you know how best you would use that money already right now 31 % of Iowans are working full time and cannot make ends meet and 59 % of our fellow Americans cannot pay an unexpected $ 500 bill they are living paycheck to paycheck week to week and you know that is the reality
There ' s a general belief among Americans that most veterans suffer from a mental health issue , despite that number being much , much smaller . The first thing we need to do is better inform the American people and , in particular , employers on this reality to combat this prejudice against hiring veterans .
While an unfathomable amount of money has been spent on military engagements that have accomplished little , our infrastructure has started to collapse , and our people are living paycheck to paycheck and falling prey to ills like drug abuse . We need to make sure we are strong at home if we are going to successfully project our values abroad .
Voters are concerned about money in politics , and they should be . A handful of wealthy individuals can now raise their voices louder than millions of ordinary Americans put together . The flood of money in politics has led to increased mistrust and disenchantment in our government , and rightly so . Big money in politics is far more likely to support candidates who will protect the interest of the wealthy that elected these candidates in the first place .

Use a VAT on digital advertisements and data use to ensure every person whose data is used for tech companies to sell ads and sustain their business model will get a slice of every digital ad .
Require algorithms on platforms that allow political advertisements or the sharing of news stories to be open source , or confidentially disclosed to the Department of the Attention Economy .
The advancement of technology in America has driven the advancement of humanity nationally and globally . But technology has also outpaced our government ' s understanding of it , and regulations are falling short of protecting us from Big Tech companies that are prioritizing profits over our well - being .
We need new investments to make our voting systems secure and usable . This will both ensure that voters are able to exercise their civic duties with ease , and allow them the peace of mind that their vote will not be compromised or lost .

On a similar note , we should investigate ways to improve and expand the Choice Act to lower wait times and expand access and increase the efficacy of our electronic records database to make it easier for veterans to find healthcare where they are .
We need to help keep Americans safe from gun violence and white nationalism , domestic terrorism , and all forms of extremism .

Restoration of Voting Rights for Felons
Through the Voting Rights Act , require states to get permission from the Department of Justice before implementing any voter ID laws .
As President , I will :
Why do we accept a system that leads us to feel that we ' re voting for the person who is going to do the least bad instead of the most good ? It ' s because our all - or - nothing voting system forces us to pick candidates we think can win , regardless of how well they align with our values .

When I talked with Christian Picciolini , he noted that children  ' usually young boys  ' who suffer traumatic  ' potholes ' are significantly more likely to search for a community and be targeted by white nationalist groups . Trauma , abandonment , and loss have all been cited as primary drivers in turning people towards white nationalism . We need to intervene so that these children can deal with their trauma and become contributing members of our society .
he bought a guitar and was playing shows for the first time in years poor Kyle was a guitar for Jody in New Hampshire was car repairs to visit her daughter from Mallory in Florida it was going back to school at the age of 68 this is what the freedom dividend would mean for us in real life and this is the vision that you can make a reality like this Iowa because this is this is the your power and your power alone now my first move my first goal was not
My approach is four pronged :
Invest in Cybersecurity
For decades , our voting system has disenfranchised and discriminated against Native Americans and Alaska Natives . Restrictive laws that require traditional street addresses and voter ID laws that do not accept tribal identification make voting registration difficult for Native Americans . Limited polling sites and resources require that Native Americans travel great distances to vote , sometimes up to 150 miles . 22
sound like this hey Andrew how ' s it going what can I do for you it ' ll be seamless efficient a little bit sexy perhaps what is that gonna mean for the two and a half million Americans who work in call centers right now making $ 14 an hour how many of you seen a self - serve kiosk in a fast - food restaurant McDonald ' s they ' re gonna be in every location in the United States by 2021 at McDonald ' s and the other chancing in a
African American net worth is projected to go to zero by 2050 334 years from now now you might be looking at yourselves being like how is that possible how could the median African American net worth be projected to go to zero over the next thirty four years and I ' m here to tell you exactly how that ' s going to happen right now the dynamics of this winner - take - all economy are about to take off I have many friends in Silicon Valley and what we know is that capital
Unfortunately , our government is unequipped to handle it . We dissolved the Office of Technology Assessment in 19952 . Recent hearings 3 with tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg exposed the lack of basic understanding of technology by members of our Congress .
Provide for consumer protections
in 2020 I love you all put the money in for him the money in our hand the money our hand put them on our head put the money in our head yeah
father worked for GE and then IBM my father ' s a physicists my mother ' s an artists my brother ' s a psychology professor and I became an entrepreneur and CEO I built an education company that was sold to a public company in 2009 and I looked at the nation ' s problems at that point I made a little money and so I thought to myself well what are the biggest problems that I see and the biggest problems that I saw were that so much money and energy and talent
Promote the nationwide adoption of recognition of protections afforded by a series LLC
Lobbyists .
Staffing needs to be improved . Salaries and benefits should be increased in order to fully staff and maintain best - in - class doctors and administrative staff . Clear metrics for success in each role should be established , and individuals who are not measuring up need to be let go . There also needs to be a push to hire doctors who specialize in treatment of women ' s issues , including sexual trauma , and issues facing our transgender veterans , as well as expanding options for these veterans to receive treatment outside of the VA system if they so choose .
The past four years have been the four hottest on record , and July 2019 was the hottest month ever recorded . Greenland is expected to lose 440 billion tons of ice this year , a rate that was the  ' worst - case scenario ' for 2070 . The West is on fire , the middle of the country is flooded , and the Atlantic is seeing hurricanes of increasing frequency and intensity . In Alaska , salmon are dying because of the heat . All the while , the top 5 US oil and gas companies posted revenues over $ 760 billion ( 1 ), and the federal government subsidized the industry to the tune of $ 26 billion annually ( 2 ).
Republicans have been selling that triple down trickle down garbage for decades and we know it doesn ' t work at all they even know it doesn ' t work they know it ' s nonsense so we ' re going to build a trickle up economy from our from our people up our families up and our communities up and that ' s the first big move I ' ll make as president the second is that we need to get healthcare costs off
This Reverse Boot Camp would involve a number of group classes and individual consultations with experts in the military , veterans , and private - sector experts in order to ensure that all veterans are equipped to successfully transition to civilian life .
As President , I will '
Pass a Medicare for All system that fully covers mental health and trauma services for victims of domestic terrorism .
people sense I just want to move us forward it ' s not left it ' s not right Virginia make America take harder am I going to come right here back to Northern Virginia next year as your president to make it to you all to your kids and make history together in this election
Ban anyone who serves in my administration from lobbying for a period of time after they leave their position .
In order to improve voter participation , we have to ensure that we provide every eligible American access to a convenient and secure way to register to vote .
this is not my idea then it is not a new idea Thomas Paine was forward at the founding of our country Martin Luther King fought for it in the 60 s and it is what he was fighting for when he was killed in 1968 a thousand economists endorsed it in the 60 s past the US House of Representatives twice in 1971 under Nixon of all people came this close to being laws called a Family Assistance Plan and I talked to some of the democratic politics the
When starting their service , members of the armed forces go through a boot camp in order to ensure that they ' re ready for the rigors of service . As they end their service , they should go through an equally important training program on elements of civilian life that would not be second - nature to someone who has had a regimented routine over the past several years .
Yes . You can ' t find solutions to problems if you ' re not willing to talk . I would engage with North Korea without preconditions in order to find a path towards complete , verifiable , and irreversible denuclearization . We can ' t leave any options off the table , and we need to accept incremental gains in order to reach our eventual goal .
Finally , as gun suicide disproportionately affects veterans , we should provide free gun safes / storage for all veterans , which has been shown to significantly reduce suicide risk .
automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Missouri Wisconsin and nearly 40 , 000 right here in Iowa how many of you personally know someone who has lost his or her job in manufacturing over the last number of years I ' m sure a number of you do and I ' ve been in the in these communities in the aftermath of the plant closing I heard from Mitch right here an old wine in Northeast Iowa what happened there when jobs disappeared
Ending the Influence of Lobbyists
As President , I will :
Organizations like the NRA have spent over a hundred million dollars over the past decade , lobbying against any and all gun safety legislation . They ' ve spent tens of millions in a single year lobbying legislators to fight against even constitutional , popular gun safety legislation .
stores and malls into oblivion and you know that working in retail is the most common job in the economy the average retail worker is a 39 year old woman making between 10 and $ 11 an hour and we know she does not have much savings what ' s her move going to be when those malls and stores closed how much did Amazon pay in federal taxes last year zero that ' s right they ' re this giant vacuum cleaners sucking the vitality out of your neighborhoods and
Build a sustainable world . The United States , throughout history , has led the world in times of crisis . We ' re the most entrepreneurial country in the history of the world . It ' s time to activate the American imagination and work ethic to provide the innovation and technology that will power the rest of the world .
Improving Health , Increasing Options
As President , I will '
Too many of our veterans have been trained to a high level in skills that aren ' t respected when they get back home . These veterans often need to spend thousands of dollars and a significant amount of time receiving a certification to do a job that they ' ve been doing throughout their service .
This is just a small list of policies we need to implement around gun safety . To see a complete list of Andrew ' s proposals , please read his entire Gun Safety policy here .
Each of us generates a significant amount of data each day 4 during the normal course of our activities , and our data is now worth more than oil . 5 Our phones and computers track our movement and actions , while our browsers and websites track our online activities . As we ' ve seen , some of the largest tech companies can know more about us and our lives than our families and those closest to us . That ' s what happens when about 90 % 6 of all online searches globally are done on just one platform .
Nationally , 25 % of African - American voting - age citizens lack a government - issued photo ID , compared to 8 % of White voting - age citizens .( 11 ) The income gap plays major role in explaining this difference . Obtaining a government issued ID can easily cost $ 75 to $ 175 in transport fees , waiting times , and paying for supporting papers like birth certificates , which are not as easily accessible to minority communities living in poverty . When states enact voter ID laws , their turnout decreases by 2 - 3 % and primarily affects ages 18 - 23 , new voters , and African - American voters . 12
I would reenter the TPP in conjunction with policies to ensure the benefits are widely shared , like a VAT , border - adjustment tax , and the Freedom Dividend , a universal basic income of $ 1 , 000 / month for all American adults .
Restore voting rights for current inmates unless they have deprived someone else of their right to vote .
The US should also restore our USAID programs for Palestinians that have been ended by this administration .
Revive the Office of Technology Assessment and establish a Department of Technology .
Provide funding to states to update their voter enrollment systems to electronic ones , and to integrate with federal systems , as well as each other , to ensure up - to - date voter information and easy transfer of data .
where everyone in that state now gets between one and two thousand dollars a year no questions asked and what state is that what is the oil of the 21 st century technology AI self - driving cars and trucks a study just came out that said that our data is now worth more than oil where is all that digne money going it was on Facebook in the trillion - dollar tech companies that pay zero or near zero in taxes and I am just like you
Regulation that requires online game publishers to increase transparency of draw probability for virtual items , and limitations on number of loot box purchases , would be a start . We also need increased parental control for these items so that children don ' t end up responsible for large charges .
It would also ensure that all veterans are aware of the myriad programs available to them , including employment , health , and other support services .
registered to vote and if you ' re not you should definitely pretend they ' re registered to vote we need you to make sure and sign a clipboard before you leave here tonight can you do that for me a signature is that will get us closer to this goal of 5 , 000 on yellow say the way it works is that the Secretary of State they ' re kind of sticklers about this stuff so what they do is they try and find reasons to reject signatures so the requirement is
As President , I will '

Ensure that  ' free - to - play ' games marketed to minors do not rely on exploiting child psychology for profit , and guarantee that every in - game purchase is approved by an adult .
Even the content for children on these platforms isn ' t subject to any rules and standards the way they are on TV . This lack of regulation means that our children are exposed to extreme and inappropriate content at younger and younger ages .
Fighting the Rise of White Nationalism and Extremism
retail and trade right now and three of your seventeen malls are in danger of closing this is going to get worse there are another over 30 , 000 Iowans who drive a truck for a living and this is the most common job in 29 states my friends in Silicon Valley and I am friends with some of them please don ' t hold against me but my friends in Silicon Valley are working on trucks that can drive themselves they say that there are 98 % of the way there and these trucks will
But the benefits these services have given us have begun to clash with the wellbeing of society .
next move when the store closes when the mall closes when you want to call the customer service line of a big company you do the same thing I do which is what you dial zero zero zero human human human se representative representative until we get something online right there Hannah that ' s what you do oh yeah we all do it because that that software is miserable you ' re like oh you know they gave me a human butt in two or three short years the software is gonna
Automatic voter registration utilizes existing government entities to gather reliable information about eligible citizens automatically registers them to vote . This system creates an infrastructure for increased accuracy of voting records and establishes an electronic system that is cheaper and easier to update . Not only does it make the voting process more convenient for voters , it has shown to increase voter registration rates by over 60 %. 5
Notify the public before conducting voter roll purges .
My plan to help every single American vote will dramatically increase voter turnout and create a more functional and representative democracy . It will allow America to point to its elections as a model for the democratic process that aligns with the values we are bound to fight for at home and overseas .
both tomorrow but then when you vote bring a clipboard with you and just say hey you want to sign this petition to get Andrew young on the ballot in Virginia you get a few dozen people we get enough of you to do that I mean we ' re gonna be done like that look out a native 200 of you get 50 that ' s 10 , 000 we ' re done do you wanna help us finish this off Virginia and this is the same where we ' ll be when
Provide grants to school districts with alternative , rehabilitative disciplinary plans .
If you don ' t believe that we need voting reform , just look at our most recent presidential election . In 2016 , only 55 % of eligible voters cast their ballots . That puts America , a model of modern democracy , behind almost every European country , as well as Mexico , South Korea , Israel , Canada , and Australia when it comes to voter participation . To me , this is a national embarrassment . America is the leader of the free world , and our elections should reflect that . If we want a truly representative democracy , we need true access to the ballot box .
Universal background checks and red flag laws
10 . Under what circumstances , if any , would you support the United States joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans - Pacific Partnership ( CPTPP ), formerly the Trans - Pacific Partnership ?
We need to get this money out of politics if we want to have any chance of ending the gun violence epidemic plaguing this country .
Give States All the Money they Need
we are experiencing the greatest technological and economic shift in human history we need a way to help millions of Americans transition through this period and a universal basic income is the best and most efficient way to do that hello I ' m Andrew yang and I ' m running for president as a Democrat in 2020 I believe I have the right vision priorities and values to improve the lives of millions of Americans seven years ago I started venture for America
Digital giants such as Facebook , Amazon , Google , and Apple have scale and power that renders them more quasi - sovereign states than conventional companies . They ' re making decisions on rights that government usually makes , like speech and safety . Their business models are predicated on keeping people engaged , driven by algorithms that are supercharged by technology to predict our behavior , such as artificial intelligence and machine learning , and that feed off of our data , creating an increasing asymmetry of power without any accountability .
Incentivize gun manufacturers to limit after - market alterations .
Determining monopoly power requires us to make clear distinctions on market player vs . market platform . If Amazon is the marketplace , it shouldn ' t be competing as a market player , as well . It ' s difficult for Amazon or Apple to guarantee credibility to other market actors that they won ' t take advantage of their access to information and their ability to shape the market conditions . Consolidation of data assets , shutting down competition ( even if it won ' t affect prices ), and the lack of competitive business formation should all be considered when determining whether the government needs to take action against a business .
Expand our education system to provide daycare and early childhood education for all .
communities and you ' re getting zero back this is the buzzsaw this is capital and technology converging in historic ways this is going to be an economic natural disaster or unnatural disaster if you want to look at it that way and who loses in a natural disaster you do communities of color people with lower resources people with lower access to capital and Technology are going to be the big losers all right have I convinced you that things are even worse
Everyone eligible to vote on election day should be free to do so . However , as highlighted by the disproportionate impact of voter ID laws and inconvenient polling locations , the lower the income that an individual or family has , the greater the barriers they face to voting , resulting in significantly lower turnout . 26 Too many Americans are unable to take time off from work , as they ' re living paycheck - to - paycheck or are hourly workers who can ' t lose the time .
5 , 000 but if you want to be saved you ' ve got to put up 7 , 000 8 , 000 9 , 000 to 10 , 000 because they did they ' re jerks then you ' re like hey we ' re still over 5 , 000 so shut up so right now 3 , 000 we need to clear eight nine ten thousand and we need your help to do so being an entrepreneur being an operator it ' s not about branding the hype it ' s about making sure you actually succeed at the ground level so one of the reasons why I ' m proudest
12 . What has been the greatest foreign policy accomplishment of the United States since World War II ? What has been the biggest mistake ?
The right to download all data in a standardized format to port to another platform
The right time to deal with this crisis was decades ago . We ' ve waited too long , so we need to act fast and recognize that all options need to be on the table in order to adapt to the changed world we live in while mitigating behaviors that make it worse and reversing the damage we ' ve already done . We can ' t dismiss any ideas  ' especially not those that have support from the scientific community  ' or rule anything out because it doesn ' t fit our ideological framework .
Yet , the Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ), which provided valuable research and briefings to inform our legislative branch , was phased out in 1995 . 15
In order to help veterans find fulfilling and stable careers , the government should research and maintain a database of in - demand skills and professions , and match veterans to these jobs based on their skills . The government can also partner with businesses in these areas to match up qualified candidates , and incentivize businesses to hire veterans . This can take the form of subsidies , both for the hiring itself and also for the investment in helping the veteran transition from their career in the military to their career at this business , since the rigidity , culture , requirements , and networking required can be very different , and a transition / learning window is often required .
The first step to any action on climate change is to rejoin the Paris Accords so that we have the moral authority and allies in order to fight the existential threat that is climate change .
Amend the Voting Rights Act
Clarify the tax implications of owning , selling , and trading digital assets
We need to get our combat troops out of Afghanistan . By utilizing our diplomatic options , we can bring our troops home during my first term .
In order to improve access and efficiency , many more GP centers should be opened , especially in rural areas , so that no veteran needs to travel a significant distance to see a doctor ( the Choice Act can help with this , as well ). If a veteran needs to travel to a specialized treatment center , transportation should be provided or subsidized .
To change our country ' s relationship with voting , we ' ll need to do more than just provide access ; we ' ll need to change attitudes . We can enhance every American ' s faith in government by getting them more involved in the process , but first we must build trust .
But it ' s also a massive opportunity .
Move our people to higher ground . Natural disasters and other effects of climate change are already causing damage and death . We need to adapt our country to this new reality .
The historic achievement of the Voting Rights Act ( VRA ) in 1965 made it possible for millions of Americans to vote for the first time , disabling a variety of discriminatory laws . Unfortunately , in Shelby County v . Holder ( 2013 ), the Supreme Court overturned a single section of the VRA . The absence of this section reduced federal oversight , allowing 846 jurisdictions to change their state voting laws and close or move local polling places in a discriminatory way . 2 Poll closures make it challenging for low - income voters to cast their ballots .
Restore voting rights to individuals convicted of felonies and prohibit states from denying ex - felons the right to vote .
In short , our government ' s knowledge of technology and ability to regulate it and the market is being outpaced by innovation . We need a new generation of leadership that understands these new and emerging technologies so that proper frameworks can be developed to protect consumers and ensure innovation and competition .
