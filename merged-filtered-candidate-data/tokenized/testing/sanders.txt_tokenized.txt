 ' To give security to these countless homes ,  ' he said ,  ' they must be shielded from the two giant marauders , war and tyranny .  '
Insane as it may sound , I suppose that the 900 DACA recipients who now serve in the United States military today could find themselves in the position of being arrested and deported from the country that they are putting their lives on the line to defend . And some people say ,  ' Well , that ' s farfetched .  ' Well , I ' m not so sure . It could happen . How insane is that ? But that ' s where we are today and that ' s what could happen if we do not do the right thing and this week pass legislation here in the Senate to protect the Dreamers .
At the outset , I think it is important to recognize that the world of today is very , very different from the world of Winston Churchill of 1946 . Back then we faced a superpower adversary with a huge standing army , with an arsenal of nuclear weapons , with allies around the world , and with expansionist aims . Today the Soviet Union no longer exists .
A heavy - handed military approach , with little transparency or accountability , doesn ' t enhance our security . It makes the problem worse .
the future of this country is extraordinary and there is nothing
During the Congressional fight over the Republicans ' massive tax giveaway to the wealthy , some of my colleagues were very open this . Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was very frank : If Republicans failed to pass the bill , he said  ' the financial contributions will stop .  ' This , he went on ,  ' will be the end of us as a party .  ' I applaud Senator Graham for his honesty .
The time is long overdue for a vigorous discussion about our foreign policy , and how it needs to change in this new era .
running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy human rights diplomacy and world peace the United States must leave the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change militarism authoritarianism and global wealth inequality that is why we need 1 million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish all of these goals needless
And he also reminded us that ; " Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signifies , in the final sense , a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed . This world in arms is not spending money alone . It is spending the sweat of its laborers , the genius of its scientists , the hopes of its children . The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this : a modern brick school in more than 30 cities . It is two electric power plants , each serving a town of 60 , 000 population . It is two fine , fully equipped hospitals . It is some 50 miles of concrete highway '.  '
Meanwhile , 30 million people have no health insurance , our infrastructure is collapsing , and hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go to college every year .
In recent years , we are increasingly confronted by the isolated dictatorship of North Korea , which is making rapid progress in nuclear weaponry and intercontinental ballistic missiles .
a February CNN report revealed that Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have transferred american - made weapons to Al qaeda - linked fighters in Yemen does anyone here think it makes sense that US weapons should be given to groups who have declared war against the United States so this war is was a humanitarian and a strategic disaster and let us also not forget that this war is being led by a despotic undemocratic regime in Saudi
In other words the votes that are going to be cast hopefully be cast today , maybe tomorrow , are not profiles in courage ! They are not members of the Senate coming up and saying ,  ' Against all of the odds , I believe that I ' m going to vote for what is right !  ' This is what the overwhelming majority of the American people want . And maybe , just maybe , it might be appropriate to do what the American people want , rather than what a handful of xenophobic extremists want . Maybe we should listen to the American people . Democrats , Republicans and Independents who understand that it would be a morally atrocious thing to allow these young people to be deported .
A few years ago my brother and I and our family went to the small town that he came from and it just stunned me the kind of courage that he showed and millions of other people showed leaving their homeland to come to a very different world  ' without money , in many cases , without knowledge of the language .
city of add item and that ceasefire which is being maintained today is enabling food and increased humanitarian aid into the country I have spoken to people at the highest level of those negotiations who have made it clear that our actions here in the Senate played a significant role in pushing Saudi Arabia toward an agreement that pressure must continue and the resolution that I hope we pass today will do just that so our effort on this issue has clearly made a
In Hungary , far - right authoritarian - nationalist leader Victor Orban models himself after Putin in Russia , saying in a January interview that ,  ' Putin has made his country great again .  ' Like Putin , Orban has risen to power by exploiting paranoia and intolerance of minorities , including outrageous anti - Semitic attacks on George Soros , but at the same time has managed to enrich his political allies and himself . In February , the Corruption Perception Index compiled by Transparency International ranked Hungary as the second most corrupt EU country .
Another problem it would make harder is that of North Korea .
We must understand that these authoritarians are part of a common front . They are in close contact with each other , share tactics and , as in the case of European and American rightwing movements , even share some of the same funders . The Mercer family , for example , supporters of the infamous Cambridge Analytica , have been key backers of Trump and of Breitbart News , which operates in Europe , the United States and Israel to advance the same anti - immigrant , anti - Muslim agenda . Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson gives generously to rightwing causes in both the United States and Israel , promoting a shared agenda of intolerance and illiberalism in both countries .
Congratulations to Chloe and her entire family . You make the United States proud .
First , I would mention climate change . Friends , it is time to get serious on this : Climate change is real and must be addressed with the full weight of American power , attention and resources .
job they have to follow a strict dress code and can be stoned to death for adultery or flawed for spending time in the company of a man who was not their relative last year saw the Saudi activists Lou Jane I ' ll have well a leader in the fight for women ' s rights was kidnapped from Abu Dhabi and forced to return to the country she is currently imprisoned along with many other human rights activists Human
Rights Watch reported and imprisoned women activists have been subjected to torture including electric shocks and other forms of physical and sexual assault the people of the entire world received a very clear understanding about the nature of the Saudi regime with the murder of Jamal khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey all of the evidence suggests that the Saudi Crown Prince was directly responsible for that murder is that really the kind of regime
Our job is to push for trade policies that don ' t just benefit large multinational corporations and hurt working people throughout the world as they are written out of public view .
The administration defends our engagement in Yemen by overstating Iranian support for the Houthi rebels . But the fact is that the relationship between Iran and the Houthis has only strengthened with the intensification of the war . The war is creating the very problem the administration claims to want to solve .
Let me say a word about some of the shared global challenges that we face today .
What foreign policy also means is that if we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad , and be taken seriously , we need to practice those values here at home . That means continuing the struggle to end racism , sexism , xenophobia and homophobia here in the United States and making it clear that when people in America march on our streets as neo - nazis or white supremacists , we have no ambiguity in condemning everything they stand for . There are no two sides on that issue .
we are going to win this election not because we have a super PAC funded by billionaires we ' re gonna win this election because we are putting together the strongest grassroots campaign in the history wants to divide us based on the color of our skin
The scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real , climate change is caused by human activity , and climate change is already causing devastating harm throughout the world . Further , what the scientists tell us is that if we do not act boldly to address the climate crisis , this planet will see more drought , more floods , more extreme weather disturbances , more acidification of the ocean , more rising sea levels , and , as a result of mass migrations , there will be more threats to global stability and security .
 ' The war is a strategic and moral disaster for the United States .  '
It gets worse . The Intercept reported that a former lobbyist for the arms manufacturer Raytheon , which stands to make billions of dollars from those sales , leads Mr . Pompeo ' s legislative affairs staff .
I should also mention that my brother Larry graduated from Brooklyn College that taught me to build a corporate empire through one of the proudest days of my life was attending the march on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by dr . boninger brothers and sisters over the last two years and before you and I and millions of Americans have fought for justice in
What Eisenhower said over 50 years ago is even more true today .
Yes . The agreement achieved by the US , Europe , Russia and China with Iran is one of the strongest anti - nuclear agreements ever negotiated . It prevented a war and blocked Iran ' s path to a nuclear weapon . I would re - enter the agreement on day one of my presidency and then work with the P 5 + 1 and Iran to build upon it with additional measures to further block any path to a nuclear weapon , restrain Iran ' s offensive actions in the region and forge a new strategic balance in the Middle East .
Here is the bottom line : In my view , the United States must seek partnerships not just between governments , but between peoples . A sensible and effective foreign policy recognizes that our safety and welfare is bound up with the safety and welfare of others around the world , with  ' all the homes and families of all the men and women in all the lands ,  ' as Churchill said right here , 70 years ago .
We must rethink the old Washington mindset that judges  ' seriousness ' according to the willingness to use force . One of the key misapprehensions of this mindset is the idea that military force is decisive in a way that diplomacy is not .
Those of us who believe in democracy , who believe that a government must be accountable to its people and not the other way around , must understand the scope of this challenge if we are to confront it effectively . We need to counter oligarchic authoritarianism with a strong global progressive movement that speaks to the needs of working people , that recognizes that many of the problems we are faced with are the product of a failed status quo . We need a movement that unites people all over the world who don ' t just seek to return to a romanticized past , a past that did not work for so many , but who strive for something better .
In closing , let me simply that in order to effectively combat the forces of global oligarchy and authoritarianism , we need an international movement that mobilizes behind a vision of shared prosperity , security and dignity for all people , and that addresses the massive global inequality that exists , not only in wealth but in political power .
How tragic it is that today , while hundreds of millions of people live in abysmal poverty , the arms merchants of the world grow increasingly rich as governments spend trillions of dollars on weapons of destruction .
At the end of the day , it is obvious that it makes far more sense to have a forum in which countries can debate their concerns , work out compromises and agreements . Dialogue and debate are far preferable to bombs , poison gas , and war .
Our job is to support governments around the world that will end the absurdity of the rich and multinational corporations stashing over $ 21 trillion dollars in offshore bank accounts to avoid paying their fair share of taxes , and then demanding that their respective governments impose an austerity agenda on their working families .
Well , I will . Today I say to Mr . Putin : we will not allow you to undermine American democracy or democracies around the world . In fact , our goal is to not only strengthen American democracy , but to work in solidarity with supporters of democracy around the globe , including in Russia . In the struggle of democracy versus authoritarianism , we intend to win .
Nearly 9 in 10 Americans favor allowing young immigrants who entered the U . S . illegally as children to remain in the United States
My father was not a political person but it turned out that , without talking much about it , he was the proudest American that you ever saw . And he was so proud of this country because he was deeply grateful that the United States had welcomed him in and allowed him opportunities that would have been absolutely unthinkable from where he came .
We should welcome young people from all over the world and all walks of life to spend time with our kids in American classrooms , while our kids , from all income levels , do the same abroad .
no they didn ' t go to jail they got a trillion dollar bailout today we say to the American people that instead of demonizing the undocumented immigrants in this country we have got a pass concrete toward citizenship we ' re gonna provide legal status got a 1 . 8 million young people water policy for those who seek asylum the United States will no longer

that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for so here is my question for you will you stand with me as part of a million - person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic nomination not only win the general election but most importantly help transform this country so that finally we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few together we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for
To illustrate this , I would contrast two recent US foreign policy initiatives : The Iraq war and the Iran nuclear agreement .
President Trump ' s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement was not only incredibly foolish and short - sighted , but it will also end up hurting the American economy .
however over many years Congress has abdicated that responsibility through Democratic presidents and Republican presidents today we begin the process of reclaiming our constitutional authority by ending u . s . involvement in a war that has not been authorized by Congress and is clearly unconstitutional last assemble this body made history for the first time since the war powers resolution was passed in 1973 a majority of United States senators 56 of us in a
The United States is deeply engaged in this war . We are providing bombs the Saudi - led coalition is using , we are refueling their planes before they drop those bombs , and we are assisting with intelligence .
a desperate company cannot be true but what I ' m going to tell you is that coming from a middle - class family about money or really lack of money was always a point of stress in our family my mother ' s dream was that someday rent controlled apartment to a home that tree was never fulfilled she died while we still live in that control of the park my experience as a child living in a family that struggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my
we please make no mistake about the struggle that we are undertake is not just about the feeding Donna trouble this struggle is about saving on the incredibly powerful institutions that control the economic and political life of our nation the true publicist
My point is that we need to look at foreign policy as more than just the crisis of the day . That is important , but we need a more expansive view .
criminal justice report the international of the United States having more people in jail than any other country on earth in jails and incarceration we are going to invest in jobs and education No no keeping people in jail because they
US foreign aid should be accompanied by stronger emphasis on helping people gain their political and civil rights to hold oppressive governments accountable to the people . Ultimately , governments that are accountable to the needs of their people will make more dependable partners .
We also face the threat of these groups obtaining weapons of mass destruction , and preventing that must be a priority .
in our country that you and your children deserve quality affordable childcare and today here at Brooklyn College we say to young people all over this country we want you to get the best education you can regardless of your income good jobs require a good education and that is why we are going to make
