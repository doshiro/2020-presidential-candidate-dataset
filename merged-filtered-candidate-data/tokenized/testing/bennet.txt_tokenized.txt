the months and now stretching into years and how these people around here who declare that their constitutional conservatives have put up with a president who obviously doesn ' t care about the rule of law doesn ' t care about the separation of powers as you can see here isn ' t concerned about having an independent judiciary wants to threaten the leading journalists of this country calling them fake news but I would think this step would be one step too far even
the wall the wall the president says has already been mostly built that he ' s now declaring a national emergency to build the world is racing ahead of us as I ' ve said on this floor over and over again what we ' re getting run around by one in named distraction after another it ' s been said that the president is somebody who was mostly concerned with winning the politics of any given day that ' s what he tries to do and he ' s often very effective at it we spend a lot of time

from generations of American foreign possible the Obama administration this is about a set of traditional American values and approach to the world that we ' ve had almost since the nation ' s founding and the space that the president is creating out there in the world by abandoning those treasured American values give space to those who seek every single day to undermine the liberal world order that has allowed our countries and allies across the globe to

again during his campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall he said at the beginning of the campaign he said it in the middle of the campaign he said it at the end of the campaign he made that promise over and over again the United States Congress didn ' t make that promise there is no way for Congress to force Mexico to pay for the wall we cannot force Mexico to pay for the wall it is not Congress ' s fault it is the president ' s fault and it is
Texas I can ' t imagine that it does I don ' t know how anybody could support that and by the way that ' s not even the most important point the most important point is that we have ground ourselves up for a 35 day government shutdown for three months of media cycles on this fight by the president on a wall that he now says is almost fully built while he ' s declaring an emergency to build a wall that hasn ' t been built while we ' re
it ' s somebody around here has a way of persuading Mexico to build the wall or pay for the wall which I don ' t think there ' s a single person here who has that kind of influence as influential as all of us think we are it ' s amazing to me and I stand I don ' t understand it why people would cash in their conservative principles so cheaply three point six billion dollars the idea that you ' d be willing to give up your principles in such a tawdry exchange
the president has taken a step back from a crisis that he provoked crisis that he caused and it seems like maybe it ' s a rare recognition on his part that when a president speaks in a president acts they speak and they act on behalf of the American people not on their own behalf and the American people could not stand the idea that this country would do what it did to these kids in their name could not stand the idea that the whole world would see the separation of children

mr . president if we allow science to become debatable we can contort our thinking to fit any action at all to support or undermine any public policy we risk discarding facts we don ' t like and ignoring experts with whom we don ' t agree in favor of special interests who often dominate our political system our country needs more from us and that our national defense demands more than that from us when State Department analysts concluded with evidence over with I ' m

represent the will of the American people we may never get another vote like this around here this is going to be the time that each of us is going to decide whether we ' re going to act to preserve these institutions for the next generation or the weather we ' re going to continue to degrade them in our mindless partisanship and in this case to somehow fulfill a promise the president never could keep that would be a shameful day
his promise that he has broken instead of going to Mexico to get them to pay for the wall as he said he would do over and over again he ' s now asked Congress to pay for he ' s now asked the American taxpayer to fulfill his broken promise and by the way that ' s after two years of having a Republican majority in the Senate and a Republican majority in the house who said we don ' t want to build your wall we ' re not going to help you keep your
he ' s going to declare a national emergency to pay for the wall we should ask ourselves we must ask ourselves whether this is an appropriate use of emergency power and by the way if it was an appropriate use of emergency power why didn ' t he just declare an emergency before he shut the government down for 35 days what why cost the economy billions and billions of dollars if you can just do this by declaring an emergency well the easy answer for that
promise in fact you promised Mexico would pay for the wall go get Mexico to pay for the wall is what the Republican Senate and Republican House said so he was frustrated he said how frustrating was he went out to the American people during the 2018 election and the people who rewarded him by electing Democrats to be the majority in the House of Representatives then last December those Democrats offered the present 1 . 3 billion dollars for

that ' s never happened before in American history and by the way if we go down this road this won ' t be the furnace will not be the last time this happens this will happen time and time again which is why every member of the Senate should vote against this or vote for this measure of disapproval since 1976 when Congress passed the national emergencies act presidents have declared national emergencies 58 times 53 of those times have been to do things like block the

Consider what happened in 2015 . That year , President Obama announced the Clean Power Plan to slash America ' s carbon emissionsto 32 % below 2005 levels by 2030 . Instead of rallying behind this effort , many activists made the Keystone Pipeline their cause . According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency , stopping the pipeline would have reduced our emissions by less than 1 %. When Democrats opposed the pipeline , union workers across Colorado saw it as a direct rebuke . For them , pipefitting had become a source of steady work after factories had long shuttered and left .

We also need to connect climate change to everyday lives . Concern about melting ice caps and endangered species is justified , but it has little resonance beyond our cities and coasts . On the other hand , every farmer and rancher in Colorado understands that persistent droughts and wildfires directly threaten their business and way of life . Likewise , many in Colorado know that warming temperatures endanger our skiing , fly fishing and outdoor recreation .
the years to come American farmers and manufacturers would fill millions of crates of wheat and wood of sugar and steel to rebuild Europe from the ravages of war President Truman understood that in time strong European economies would become strong trading partners strong military allies and a bulwark of freedom against Soviet expansion history proved him right to say the least after the Marshall Plan Western Europe surged back to life as Eastern Europe

the institutions the way they did and that ' s why they created the checks and balances that they did there is a reason no president has ever done what this president is trying to do because they exercise self - restraint because of what ' s in the Constitution and because nobody on this floor would have supported them there are many ways this generation of past politicians and I and I accept my share of the blame there are many ways
sorry when State Department analysts concluded that the evidence with science that the Keystone pipeline would not materially increase carbon emissions facts lost in the phony debate here in Washington I voted for it against intense opposition from my own party and many of my strongest supporters that was a painful vote one of the most painful I have ever taken and difficult to explain too many people I admire but I was

bill that we passed in 2013 that is the border security bill that we should pass the day today and the only reason that it is not the law of the land today is because the house would not let it come to a vote had that let it come to a vote had the speaker allowed it to come to a vote it would have passed so I think collectively we should go back to that work and see if we can ' t actually solve the problem rather than just play politics with it in the case of what
