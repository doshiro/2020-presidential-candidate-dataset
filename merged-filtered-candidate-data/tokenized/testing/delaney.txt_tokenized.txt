Assist in clean energy projects including solar installation , improving building efficiency , developing community gardens , and increasing awareness about sustainable practices
The Democratic Party cherishes opportunity over birthright ; wants people to earn a good living ; offers a helping hand to the poor , the immigrant and those left behind ; wants all Americans to have health care ; embraces diversity , equality and justice ; understands the importance of global engagements ; believes that government can do transformative things ; and stands ready to provide for our common defense . This is why I ’ m a Democrat . But we have a lot of work to do , given our recent electoral failures , and we need a different approach — one that ’ s focused on the facts and the future .
I will promote NET , thus bringing down the cost , through a reverse auction program that gives first access to government subsidies to the companies that can capture and store atmospheric carbon for the lowest cost .
Third , revive arms control negotiations with Russia and pursue them with China . We are at risk of a new nuclear arms race with Russia . We must determine whether the Intermediate - Range Nuclear Forces Treaty ( INF ) is salvageable . I also pledge to seek a new strategic arms agreement between the U . S . and Russia . New Start is the last remaining major U . S .- Russian arms control agreement with major limitations and verification procedures . It expires on February 5 , 2021 – just days after the next president takes office . I will also explore the possibility of arms control with China , particularly in the area of intermediate - range missiles .
This is what I am focused on presenting here today – a foreign policy vision based in American ideals and values , strength , and standing with our allies and alliances .

As for our strategic partnership with Israel , it will remain strong and bipartisan under my presidency . I am completely committed to the security of Israel and recognize them as one of the most important and enduring allies to the United States . I am firmly against efforts to delegitimize Israel , such as BDS . The issue of how to achieve peace with the Palestinians , who inhabit the same geographic space , remains on the table . For decades , the United States invested considerably in an effort to achieve a two - state solution , which I have always supported and continue to support . But ultimately , for any solution to succeed , it must be the result of direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians .
Across the last several decades , as America ’ s economic share of the world decreased – largely due to rapid economic growth in other parts of the world – our diplomatic power share maintained and even grew because of U . S . engagement and leadership . Think about how remarkable that is . But I would argue that if our global engagement decreases we should expect our diplomatic power to decrease to reflect our economic share .
The Carbon Throughway is a $ 20 billion infrastructure project that we will construct to safely transport captured CO 2 to sites for permanent sequestration and reuse . Building the Carbon Throughway will create tens of thousands of jobs and spur new R & D and innovation in carbon capture . The project would be built with federal labor protections using American steel under a project labor agreement and pay workers prevailing wages . To the extent possible , the Throughway will be built along right of ways of existing pipelines and always abide by the strictest environmental standards . As the carbon fee raises the price of releasing emissions and new innovations in NET make carbon capture cost - effective , the Carbon Throughway will provide an additional financial incentive to capture carbon by facilitating its transfer for commercial uses and permanent sequestration .

ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage Maryland representative John Delaney so good evening wingding come on we can do better than that let me try something else good evening the good Democrats we ' re going to send JD Shelton to the Congress the United States that ' s more like it how ' s everyone doing this evening so in about six months you have an awesome responsibility when you go to caucus and I think you have to ask yourself two
According to the IPCC , limiting global warming to 1 . 5 ° C will require achieving net zero emissions by 2050 . We are already seeing the early effects of climate change , and that level of rapid emissions reductions is necessary to avoid the catastrophic consequences that would result from any further delay . The difference between the warming we have already experienced and the 2 ° C warming we could see if we don ’ t act now to reduce emissions is a greater risk of water scarcity , increased sea - level rise , greater damage to ecosystems and animal habitats , declines in human health , and the displacement of millions of people . In addition to the environmental effects , the Department of Defense has characterized climate change as a threat multiplier . Delaney ’ s plan will put us on the right track to reduce emissions in time to avoid the worst consequences of global warming . However , we need the international community to come together to combat global warming which is why Delaney would also rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on Day 1 of his presidency .

My vision for our foreign policy and national security starts at home .
My vision embraces free trade and leverages trade agreements to support U . S . jobs , bolster U . S . exports and to compete in the global economy . Every meeting I have with a world leader will be staffed by my chief diplomat and my chief economic advisor , as I see diplomacy and the economy as inextricably linked .
the biggest problem with Trump is that he ' s not focused on the future and he ' s not doing the things we need to do structurally to make our economy more competitive to make our country more entrepreneurial and to position people to succeed in that new economy that we all know is coming Democrats can ' t win by just attacking the trunk we really have to show the American people there ' s a better way we have to think about the
Our military has been stretched and underinvested in since the sequester began . Meanwhile , there is growing risk of an actual war between India and Pakistan , while our standoff with the nuclear - armed and unpredictable regime in North Korea continues . There are tremendous risks to the next generation and our planet posed by the dangers of global warming . We have seen what one failed state can do to global stability . Imagine the global impact of multiple highly populous states failing due climate change . The next generation also faces unsustainably high levels of sovereign debt which could limit many developed governments ability to respond to crisis . Finally , some estimate that 800 million jobs could be disrupted in the next several decades by automation and artificial intelligence .
These changes have collectively left us in many ways more vulnerable than ever before . Information , including the know - how to create and deliver weapons , is more easily shared . Disinformation campaigns , fueled by the ability of self - interested actors to masquerade as journalists and manipulate people ’ s opinions with falsehoods – and soon , completely realistic deep fakes , are powerful and effective . With advances in the area of cyberwarfare , all nations , even those unable to acquire arsenals of nuclear weapons , have the potential to change the fate of a nation and our world . And while free - market capitalism and the explosive growth in global trade have lifted billions from poverty into the middle class , we ’ ve learned that carbon derived energy that has fueled this prosperity is now causing an environmental crisis and soon a migration crisis . And the technology that has benefited us in so many ways is also now potentially causing hundreds of millions of people to have their jobs displaced or disrupted by automation and artificial intelligence .
Preventing and stopping wildfires
Our government is hamstrung by excessive partisanship . We are letting critical opportunities to improve the country pass us by . And we are not even talking about the most important thing : the future . The victims of this leadership failure are the good people we are sworn to serve , and we are leaving our country ill - prepared for dramatic changes ahead . The current administration is making us less prosperous and less secure . I ’ m running because I have an original approach to governing and an economic policy that can put us on a different course .
We cannot hope to surmount these difficulties if we do not restore our democracy to health and become more united as a people . In Churchill ’ s words , “ If we are together nothing is impossible . If we are divided all will fail .”

New Directions in Strategy and Policy
Similarly , my vision re - enfranchises the men and women of our Intelligence Community to ensure their best efforts to keep our nation secure in support of diplomatic and military efforts .
My focus is on preparing our country for the future . Technological innovation , automation and globalization are the most powerful forces in the world today . These forces have been enormously positive ; they will continue to make life better , enhance productivity , solve some of the world ’ s most difficult problems and open societies . Sadly , these forces will also eliminate certain jobs and require workers to learn new skills more quickly . They will create security risks and strain our resources . We need to respond to these large - scale opportunities and challenges by thinking about policy from a fresh perspective . What are the resources we have , how do we compete and create jobs , how can we ensure that everyone has a fair chance , and how do we protect ourselves ?
Trade unions will be utilized as the programs can leverage the successful apprenticeship model used by the trade unions
President of the United States in 2020 is to take this terribly divided nation where an American has been pitted against American and start bringing it back together and reminding us of this notion of common purpose which is worth fighting for every day of our lives and when we do that we can start getting real things done that matter we can start solving problems and we can fulfill our most sacred responsibilities which is to leave this world better than
Identify the most pressing local needs that are hindering the community from transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices
The United States can become a key partner in supporting economic growth in Africa by expanding trade agreements ( such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act ) and increasing U . S . foreign direct investment to promote manufacturing , infrastructure , and innovation of local industry . U . S . economic investment is critical as China is heavily investing in the continent through its Belt and Road Initiative , often through predatory behavior . The U . S . can adjust policies to ( 1 ) offer the U . S . as an alternative option ( as opposed to China ) for countries looking for foreign investment to create jobs , ( 2 ) support democratic initiatives and good governance policies , including election monitoring in support of free and fair elections , improving revenue collection , effective policymaking and implementation , and ( 3 ) be a helpful partner in providing resources to support economic growth that is less dependent on fossil fuels . With the stakes as high as they currently are for our climate , we must anticipate the growing population ’ s effect on the environment . A larger population and rapidly developing economy are both common causes for negative environmental outcomes .
Carbon Throughway
The Iraq War was the most disastrous foreign policy action of the United States since World War II . The most sacred responsibility of the President of the United States , hopefully in concert with the Congress , is to send our young men and women into combat . That decision should only be made in defense of the citizens of the United States or in defense of our allies or in rare circumstances in favor of crucial humanitarian objectives . In the case of our invasion of Iraq in 2003 there was no clear case made that the United States was threatened in any way by the Republic of Iraq . No unequivocal evidence was presented to support such a threat and the Bush Administration relied on faulty and highly - suspicious reporting regarding weapons of mass destruction . They had no clear plan on what to do following the invasion and the resulting chaos in Iraq led to the loss of hundreds of thousands of U . S . and Iraqi citizens as well as the destabilization of Iraq and the region . U . S . credibility around the world was undermined by our decisions in Iraq . Looking forward , we must be judicious in when we deploy troops to avoid a similar a catastrophic action .
Brings people together by exposing participants to people from different economic backgrounds , people from different parts of the country , and people with different political beliefs , which will restore an understanding of our common American identity and renew belief in our common purpose
I will seek to rejoin the JCPOA , but negotiate tougher terms on Iran upon re - entry
In the context of these economic trends , is it a surprise that many Americans are questioning everything we have done across the last several decades ? Make no mistake about it my friends , these economic realities are central to our foreign policy challenges . They were brought by irresponsible politicians who failed to do the things we should have done – in education , healthcare , tax , fiscal and technology policy – to prepare our country for rapid and profound change . And as I used to say in business , the cost of doing nothing is not nothing .
We must not have a president who is hostile to critical institutions , to the first amendment , to the rule of law , to our ethnic and religious diversity and – most importantly – to truth itself . Americans deserve better .
To continue private sector investment in the renewable energy economy , Delaney will bolster renewable energy tax credits .
My vision calls for rejoining the fight against climate change .

This also means securing our borders . It can be done . The experts tell us that a combination of electronics , manpower , fencing , and barriers is needed to curtail unlawful entry into our country . We also need comprehensive immigration reform , including a path to citizenship . In parallel , I will launch Plan Central America , inspired by the previously successful Plan Colombia , to help the governments in that region overcome the lawlessness that is at the root of population outflow to the U . S .

A strong homeland is the only basis on which we can sustain a strong national defense and global leadership . Bringing our country together , focusing on solutions , creating opportunity and encouraging responsibility , and restoring the American Dream of upward mobility for all are the fundamental pillars . In other words , building an America that broadly succeeds economically again is an integral part of my foreign policy strategy . If our country is fiscally imprudent and moving in the wrong direction , if our infrastructure is old and falling apart , if our education and health care systems don ’ t work , we will sooner or later exhaust our capacity to project power and influence around the world .
It is time for us to respond to today ’ s challenges with a similar spirit . To work together around a sense of common purpose . Where we leave narrow interests and partisanship behind .
Challenge Grants
we should not seek the Democratic answer we should seek the right answer he went on to say we should not seek to fix blame for all the problems of the past we could sit there all day and point fingers but what we should do is own a responsibility for our future as Americans that ' s where the Democratic Party has to be I don ' t want to just be your president to be your president I want to be your president to do the job to do the job and the job of the

First , protect the interests and security of the United States . It is a fundamental responsibility of our government to make sure that our people are safe . Anyone seeking the job of Commander in Chief should have that responsibility at the top of mind . We have to take threats seriously . We have to take the fight to our enemies . And we have to make sure that the entire world knows of the extreme consequences associated with harming the United States and our people – just to be clear we have a zero tolerance policy .
