In America today , it is harder and harder not just to get ahead , but to hold on to what we ' ve got .

Working and middle class families simply can ' t keep up .
Global Investment Initiative . Today , the biggest investor in infrastructure around the world is China through its Belt and Road Initiative . If we ' re going to fight the climate crisis , we need to ensure all nations are building clean energy and resilient infrastructure , which is why we will launch the Global Investment Initiative to build US developed technologies in developing nations around the world . This $ 250 billion fund will match with $ 250 billion in private investment over ten years to partner on clean energy and resilient infrastructure projects that use American technology and are built by American companies . This will harness the investments in American R & D to strengthen our economy and generate jobs at home , while simultaneously combating climate change around the globe .

I have clearly and strongly stated my support for the security of Israel , and I have also said that I disagree with policies being carried out by the current Israeli administration .

We must be no less vigilant in protecting our liberties from

democracy is in better shape our democratic republic is an elegant system but lately it hasn ' t been quite democratic enough it ' s not Democratic enough if legitimate voters are denied the ability to exercise their rights because one side thinks as a matter of political strategy that they ' re better off if fewer citizens are able to vote it is hardly democracy if citizens united means that dollars can drown out the will of the people

And by taking seriously the threat of climate disruption , we might go a long way toward improving a climate of global cooperation . So yes , the world needs America to lead on climate . And fourth , the world needs America to update the institutions through which we engage with the world , ensuring that they reflect the fact that our world is closer to 2054 than it is to 1945 . To shape this
an understanding of our interests that is true to our values . Take the case of Russia , which we should view not as a real estate opportunity , but as a self - interested , disruptive , and adversarial actor . As the most unequal economy of any major power , Russia represents a striking example of what happens when a country attempts to set up capitalism without democracy . And the forces unleashed there ; nationalism , xenophobia , homophobia , and
consequences of that scrambled period , we must remember that the lesson of the Iraq disaster is not that there is anything wrong with standing for American values , but rather that any action in the name of such values must be strategic , legitimate , and constrained by the premise that we only use force when left with no alternative . This brings me to the concept of the national interest . As any state

But when we must use force , we must also have an end game . Before , during , and after a deployment of troops , we should also deploy diplomatic , development , and security assistance to guard against future instability .

In this vein , I support recent efforts to negotiate a settlement between the regime and Guaid '; such talks can be the best route to a managed transition . I would also continue to apply targeted sanctions against regime officials -- but broad economic sanctions , such as those pursued by the Trump administration , run the risk of hurting innocent Venezuelans already face crippling food and medicine shortages and enabling the Maduro regime to promote the false narrative that the U .

from the beginning my campaign for president has been driven by the awareness that we face not just another presidential election but a transition between one ERA and another a fact of which the current presidency is as much a symptom as a cause I believe that the next three or four years will determine the next 30 or 40 for our country in our world and in that context I ' m thankful for this opportunity to share the worldview that shapes my understanding

That means strict enforcement of new and existing labor laws to rebalance power toward workers and ensurethat new industries and technologies fuel growth , not more inequality . That means public investments that lead to thriving workers , children , and families . And that means providing Americans with low - cost , high - quality public options in health and education that spurs competition and drives the private sector to improve .

Close the  ' Charleston loophole .  ' Under federal law , if a federally - licensed gun dealer who has initiated a background check has not been notified within three business days that the sale would violate federal or state laws , the sale can go forward by default .

Until a background check is completed , gun sales must be prohibited from taking place .

Make background checks universal and close the loopholes that allow dangerous individuals to acquire and keep guns . After each new mass shooting , it has become routine to learn that the perpetrator acquired their guns legally .

Russian aggression against Ukraine is an attack on the agreed principles and rules of European and global order that protect global citizens beyond Ukraine , including Americans . Ukraine ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity is protected by the UN Charter and European security agreements , which the Russian Federation has signed and is obligated to respect . The OSCE mission and Minsk agreement both obligate Russia to resolve the conflict peacefully with Ukraine . We must keep tough , targeted , and effective economic and financial sanctions on Russia as long as it continues to assault Ukrainian territory and citizens , and continues to illegally occupy Ukrainian territory in the Donbas and Crimea .

More and more Americans are confronting the challenges of aging , as Baby Boomers continue to approach retirement . After full careers , many Americans continue working longer because they can ' t afford to retire . For the first time in our nation ' s history , there will be more older adults than children . 1 In 2020 , half of adults who reach 65 will require long - term care . 2 By 2026 , we will require 7 . 8 million new care jobs . At the same time , more and more Americans are becoming eligible for Social Security ' even as the Trump Administration has attempted to undermine Americans ' retirement by cutting billions of dollars from Social Security over the next decade . 3 Politicians in Washington have known this crisis was intensifying for years . And for years , they have failed to address it . It is time for a new approach .

Enact a price on carbon and send rebates to Americans . My administration will work with Congress to pass an economy - wide price on carbon , which will automatically increase each year .

We will assess a border adjustment tax on any imported goods not subject to a price on carbon where they were produced , which will help protect American industries .

it is no accident that their hostility to shared values comes as they also present a greater threat to our interests . Ironically , at the very moment when American prestige and respect is collapsing , it has never been more needed that America live up to the values we profess . The world needs the best of America right now . Now , our approach to each region in the world should be guided by
cyber tools and information operations . But we must also deal with the real weaknesses that the Russians exploited . Not just the gaps in our technology , but our capacity to be too easily turned against each other . In this sense , domestic problems from racism to social isolation have revealed themselves to be national security vulnerabilities . We ' ve also seen regionally destabilizing Russian behavior , from activities on the Crimean peninsula and in eastern

After intense political debates in the years after WWII between isolationists and internationalists , I believe America ' s greatest foreign policy accomplishment has been our leadership of global efforts to promote the values that animate our own and other great democracies , to the benefit of the security and freedom of our people .

Yes , I do support a two - state solution .

To visit the West Bank and Gaza is to understand the fundamental need for a two - state solution which addresses the economic , security and moral rights of both Israelis and of the Palestinians who live there .

We must also reset our relationship with Saudi Arabia , so that our interests and values drive the relationship -- not the other way around . Our strongest alliances must be founded upon shared commitments to international law and human rights . We must be pragmatic about intelligence - sharing : totally stopping such cooperation could hinder our ability to detect and thwart threats emanating from Yemen , including from the regional al - Qaeda affiliate . But the Saudi government should not get a pass on the state - sponsored murder of an American resident abroad , nor should they be able to buy our silence on human rights abuses -- including killing civilians in Yemen and supporting extremist ideology across the Muslim world -- through purchases of US weapons .

I would support an initial freeze agreement that would have North Korea cease production of fissile material and end nuclear and missile testing , all verified by international inspectors , in exchange for targeted sanctions relief , which could be reversed if the North Koreans did not uphold their end of the bargain .

This could be accompanied with corresponding measures on sanctions relief , as well as substantive progress on building a lasting peace regime and normalizing relations .
