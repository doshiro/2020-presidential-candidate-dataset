By the time President Obama and I left the White House , we had established a new foundation of cooperation for our region built around shared responsibility , respect and partnership . It included a broader and deeper relationship with Mexico , a global agenda for cooperation with Brazil , reinvigorated engagement with Central America , post - earthquake reconstruction in Haiti , restored diplomatic ties with Cuba , support for Colombia ’ s historic peace process , improved energy security in the Caribbean , expanded trade and collaborative relations with countries throughout the region .
As home of half the world ’ s population and many of the world ’ s fastest growing economies , we cannot afford to ignore the opportunities that exist in Asia . That ’ s something every single CEO in America knows . And that ’ s why securing a Trans - Pacific Partnership has been our top priority in this administration . It is as much a foreign policy initiative , as it is an economic initiative . We ’ re not there . China will fill the vacuum just by the sheer weight and size . And it will not be in our interest .
Instead of respecting the will of their people , the governments of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua have confronted peaceful protesters with force , even armed vigilantes . They have limited the freedoms of expression and assembly necessary for political dialogue and arrested their political opponents . In Venezuela , government officials have embezzled billions of dollars from government coffers , while everyday citizens struggle to find food and medicine . It is an affront to democratic values .
We ’ re presented with an entirely new deck of cards . Some of the old cards are still there that have enormous consequence . But there ’ s many new things . Failed states , a whole range of things you all have heard about and talked about .
and fueled America ’ s prosperity throughout the 20 th century . They ’ ve earned our thanks , our respect , and our support . Finally , we have to bring the world along with us . Global action requires American leadership , But the United States only accounts for only 15 % of global carbon emissions . The rest of the world has to step up as well . On day one I will immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord . But that ’ s not sufficient . We need to dramatically accelerate our worldwide efforts to meet the intensity of this challenge we face So I ’ ll immediately get to work — leading a diplomatic initiative to get every nation to go beyond their initial commitment — to push our progress further , and faster . This is especially true for China — by far the world ’ s largest emitter of carbon .
And there used to be bipartisan consensus on almost all of those things . Joe , did you ever think you ’ d see a day when Republicans opposed infrastructure modernization ? We rank 27 th in the world in transportation infrastructure . The United States of America !
The horrific events in Orlando , the attacks in San Bernardino , Paris , Brussels , and elsewhere remind us — including in Turkey — remind us over and over again that terrorism can happen anywhere and does happen anywhere .
that you saw Charlotte ' s ville I know at the time I wrote an article for saying about Charlotte ' s ville when you saw these neo - nazis carrying carrying swastikas coming out of the fields with torches with contorted looks on her face accompanied by white supremacists chanting hate and deceit and going on and talking abut you ' re using the same anti - semitic pile that was used in the 30 s in the United in Germany and then the president when the rest of the world
people identified how do you how do we regain our leadership role by reminding ourselves in the United States and I would respectfully suggest in Europe that there ' s not a single challenge that you mentioned that we can meet alone than any one of us can meet alone I mean you think about I mean that in a literal sense not in a nod is not hyperbole and each of these requires coordination reaching out getting some consensus to be able to act as a community not just
hundred billion in loop now it ' s one trillion six hundred billion what ' s happening to us look the super wealthy have gotten significant health as a consequence of those loopholes and greater incentives for companies the ship job over some jobs overseas in those loopholes folks look you know as a consequence of his tax cut and I said it when it was being passed when they were they were moving it he ' s going to use it as an excuse by creating a def these
Because when America leads , the way that only we can , guided by principle , grounded in our conviction that America does best when we make sure everyone does better , no nation can match us .
done remarkable things when the middle class has been given just an even chance just an even chance but today an awful lot of folks are worried that the American Dream is literally slipping from their grasp well beyond the beyond the promise for their children have our 35 percent American people saying they do not believe that their children will be able to have the same opportunities they had be able to have the same standard of living they had that ' s the
able to do the things they want look as I said I ' m gonna go in a lot more detail later but let me just say this we need to invest and restore the middle class and we have to have an ambitious plan it ' s about the future the future folks we need to rebuild America with clean renewable energy cleaner safety fair faster transportation to confront the existential threat that climate change poses for all of us and guys this is not a deal where you have to punish anybody
This is not to say we were perfect — far from it . Other international issues competed for our attention and entrenched challenges of poverty , violence and corruption continued to stymie growth and opportunity , particularly in El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras . But for the first time , it was possible to envision a hemisphere that was secure , middle class and democratic , from the northern reaches of Canada to the southern tip of Chile .
ambassador Bert and I were talking about that a moment ago it literally literally is we ' re at an inflection point and I think everyone in this room no matter what country you represent understands that at least I hope we do not because the challenge is proliferating around the world are beyond our capacity to shape and Bend for the benefit of all humankind as we ' ve done so often before but not because of the autocrats and who are destined because autocrats were
Joe , I spoke with 17 Republican senators just on the Supreme Court . All 17 say , Joe , I know you ’ re right . But don ’ t ask me to move yet , Joe . This will happen to me .
Throughout our administration we ’ ve kept laser focus on homeland security . Our intelligence and law enforcement professionals are coordinating and sharing information at an unprecedented level . We ’ ve invested billions of dollars since 9 / 11 . And everyone wondered whether or not we really had made the progress we say we have made . All you got to do is compare it to what it is in Europe now , and compare what they ’ re now beginning to grapple with .
back where I was it ' s such a hard job I ran for the Senate it was too difficult because they know where you live and they go and what does the supervisor do they know it ' s a tough tough job but thank you for doing it man and and I want to thank Brett and Bill human Bill and Dustin the business manager ibw local 405 and 204 respectively and I want to make no mistake about it I ' m a union guy not just labor its union
Mr . Trump ’ s shameful defense of the white nationalists and neo - Nazis who unleashed hatred and violence in Charlottesville , Va ., further abnegated America ’ s moral leadership . Not since the Jim Crow era has an American president so misunderstood and misrepresented our values .
country happened to be at Walter Reed when I couldn ' t get down there they got me in time down there for thirteen hour operation they saved my life they also did they saved my home no I want to carry these guys dude they saved my home I was doing Meet the Press oh and back a long while ago and and lightning struck my home my wife is in the home and the thick the smoke ended up being coming in through the underneath the air - conditioning system
But our greatest strength , ultimately , and I want to get back to this , is not just the example of our power , but the power of our example . Standing up for the values protects us better than any barrier we could build between ourselves and the rest of the world because our values are what draws the world to our side . And that ’ s vital . Because the unrivaled network of alliances and partnerships that we have enables us to be an effective global leader . But only if we act consistent with our values .
do to make this country grow to restore dignity to work and all the things we have to do if we will just eliminate unnecessary loopholes we have to raise any of your taxes eliminate unnecessary loopholes and the only they stands in the way is our broken political system it ' s broken the country can ' t afford for me for four more years of a president who wakes up every day to wage a war on Twitter tweet on Twitter I think of it the first way I almost slipped but guys
to help other nations reduce emissions , and mitigate and adapt . This initiative will create more than 10 million new good - paying jobs all across the clean economy in The United States of America . It ’ s an enormous opportunity — We ’ ll hold polluters accountable for the damage they ' ve caused — particularly in low - income communities and communities of color . Not only due to climate change . But the pollution they are pumping in the air that is breathed and the water that is drunk in those communities . You know , we ’ re not going to forget the workers either . The workers who through dangerous and back - breaking labor , powered our industrial rise , mined and built our arsenal of democracy ,
This is one of the most informed audiences I could possibly be speaking to on this topic . But all has changed , changed utterly in the last 15 years .
Our partners around the world are now sharing considerably more intelligence with us about the threats emanating from the region and from Europe ; and coordinating all of us , in terms of things as basic as — I won ’ t go into the list in the interest of time — but just passenger records . Prior to Paris , we didn ’ t have access .
Engaging Iran is neither incompatible with , nor at the expense of , America ’ s ironclad commitments to our allies and partners in the Middle East , including Israel . And we continue to counter Iran ’ s destabilizing activities in the region . And we will .
But we ’ ve also seized historic opportunities to build relationships beyond our traditional allies , fostering democratic transition in Burma , deepening our ties with Vietnam , managing relationships with Cuba [ sic **], expanding our partnership with India , working with ASEAN to advance rules - based order . These relationships complement our alliances and further support economic , political , and military foundations of America ’ s Pacific — America being a Pacific power through the 21 st century .
than everyone ever thought they would countering new weapons of misinformation that ' s going to affect all of us every one of us that ' s why with the transatlantic partnership at its core we need we need in my view to reach out to our partners in East Asia to fortify the collective capabilities we share we need to integrate our friends in South America and Africa and reinvigorate the broader community of democracies than we have thus far
How do we win this ? How do we win this long - term fight without embracing and engaging and having allies in the Islamic community in the United States , among American citizens and emigres ? How do we do this without allies in the Muslim world among Shiites and Sunnis ?
fact of the matter is we have to make it more affordable way to make sure the economy works not only for people of a college degree but also make it work for people who have on - the - job training trade programs Community College we can afford all this you know we can afford all this up punishing anybody we just we can put every single solitary person in Community College for free it costs 6 billion dollars a year cut the cost of four - year college in half and you and I
If you want to see the eighth wonder of the world , go down and see the two new locks of the Panama Canal . Yet there ’ s only three ports from the Gulf to Maine that can accommodate these new super Panamax ships .
together condemn the flagrant violation of international norms strengthen both by our military capacity and our people unity and I ' m so proud I ' m so proud at the coalition that was put together here in Europe to respond to the aggression of Russia in Ukraine so this is the core of our identity the very character of the American spirit and our own self - interest and I promise you I promise you and as my mother would say this too shall pass
But starting right here in the Western Hemisphere , for the first time in history , it ’ s possible — possible — to imagine a hemisphere that is middle class , democratic , and secure from the northern reaches of Canada to Chile ’ s southern tip . That ’ s why the President turned to me one day — as he often does — and said , Joe , you do the hemisphere . Like , okay , Mr . President . You think I ’ m joking ? I ’ m not joking . You do the hemisphere . He said jokingly — he said , there ’ s not much of a time zone change . You can do it on the weekends , and you make friends easily . So just go .
The next administration should harness this momentum and build on it . But if we build walls and disrespect our neighbors , we ’ ll quickly see all this progress evaporated , replaced by a return of anti - Americanism , of coercion , rift throughout our hemisphere . The choices that make our region less democratic , less prosperous , and less secure actively undermine our American national interest .
I thank you all for being so gracious and listening , and I really — there ’ s so much talent out here , I just — if you ’ re ever going to be involved , man , this is the moment . This is the moment .
There ’ s an appealing moral clarity in grouping the world into friend and foe . But in reality , progress so often demands we work with those with whom we do not see eye - to - eye .
During my eight years as vice president , leading U . S . engagement with our partners throughout the Western Hemisphere was among the most rewarding challenges in my portfolio . Initially , progress was slow . Trust between the United States and our neighbors was at a low , driven by disagreements over the war in Iraq , the aftershocks of a great recession , a widening rift over the United States ’ long - standing Cuba policy , and an overall sense in the region that we had simply lost interest .
Iran is neither a friend nor a partner . But our willingness to engage to protect our interests , combined with international political and economic pressure on Tehran to negotiate , peacefully removed one of the greatest threats to global security : The threat of a nuclear - armed Iran .
The international community still needs a strong , democratic America leading the way . And the good news is that the United States remains better positioned than any other country to shape the direction of the 21 st century . But to succeed , we cannot abandon the tenets that we fought so hard to defend over the past seven decades — ideals that magnified American leadership and produced the greatest increase in global prosperity in history .
and I want to thank Chancellor Merkel of once again hosting us but even more for the speech that she that she gave this morning I as I said I ' ve been coming for many years and many of you know me so let me say at the outset so there ' s no mistake I strongly support NATO I believe it ' s the single most significant military alliance in the history of the world and I think it ' s been the basis upon which we ' ve been able to keep peace and stability for the past 70 years and
the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild the middle class that ' s my North Star and the reason for that is when the middle class does well everybody does well the wealthy do fine the metaclass that ' s fine and people have a way up there ' s hope there ' s optimism folks and we build the middle class when you build the middle class this time it ' s gonna make sure I ' m gonna make sure everybody comes along everybody regardless of their race their
In over 45 years of working in global affairs , I ’ ve observed a simple truth : America ’ s ability to lead the world depends not just on the example of our power , but on the power of our example .
limited to four years this administration will go down in history as an aberrant moment in time but give eight years of this administration in the White House we ' re gonna forever and fundamentally change the character of the country we can repair now God willing we win or what we ' ve gone through and we ' re going to be able to put the get back together god willing our international partnerships the fact of the matter is that we ' ve not have a
Reclaiming our values starts with standing up for them at home — inclusivity , tolerance , diversity , respect for the rule of law , freedom of speech , freedom of the press . If these are the democratic principles we wish to see around the world , America must be the first to model them .
It matters — to go back to the original thesis , it matters how you treat other nations , the respect your show or don ’ t show . Challenges surely remain . But today the reason is defined by opportunities — opportunities for greater trade and economic cooperation , especially with the open of the Panama Canal and the expansion ; opportunities for greater energy integration , with the United States is exporting liquefied natural gas throughout the region and beyond . Opportunities to end the long - running conflicts in the civil war in Colombia . We also have a major new initiative in the Northern Triangle to deal with a whole range of problems , but also a whole range of opportunities .
But these opportunities can only be seized if the next President follows the science , recognizes the danger of doing nothing , and musters the political will to address the threats .
We ’ re helping Ukraine implement vital economic reforms and root out corruption . It has not been easy . Corruption is endemic in all those former “ Soviet states ”. But by forcing them — forcing them ? Coercing them — no , not coercing them , convincing them . In that order . It takes way a significant foreign policy weapon the Russians have used so well .
imagine a parent has to maintain her and their dignity it ' s not just about if you can ' t afford like you can ' t today to get your kid to school after high after high school but think what it does to the parent when you look at you there ' s nothing worse as you all know over parents there ' s nothing worse than being able a child no they have an opportunity or a problem and not being able to respond to it my lord my lord I remember when I was
That ’ s why we ’ ve worked with more than three dozen nations to support and train Afghan forces and to hunt down al - Qaeda and other terrorist groups in their sanctuaries . That ’ s what we will continue to do so .
Consider also the difficult question of migration , particularly from Central America , where so many are fleeing crime , violence , persecution and a lack of opportunity . Securing our borders , enforcing our immigration laws , and fulfilling our humanitarian obligations is a challenging mandate , but we can — and we must — do all three at once .
consensus but I ' m looking at John Kerry he generated a consensus in Europe on Iran a significant significant agreement standing up to Russian aggression in Ukraine which I spent the significant part of my career and I see the woman who spent most of the time dealing with me the pork devil she had to spend an awful lot of time with me and dealing with making sure we had a a consensus in Europe which wasn ' t automatic initially that we deal with
Parenthetically , I ’ d note that not but two years ago , we were talking about the establishment of a caliphate that they were well on their way of doing , how that was going to bring down Saudi Arabia , Jordan , bringing chaos to the Middle East beyond what exists now . The caliphate is not a reality . And the thought of it being a reality is being crushed . But they still can do damage — just like al Qaeda without having large swaths of territory is able to do serious damage . But adopting the tactics of our enemies , using torture , threatening to kill innocent family members , indiscriminately bombing civilian populations , that not only violates our values , it ’ s deeply , deeply damaging to our security .
I ' m so ashamed he had no reason to be ashamed I got to school and got a good education but folks think of all the people you know maybe some of you think of all the people you know I ' ve been in that situation it ' s about dignity the dignity of work being able to be in a position where we have affordable education affordable health care look you know the fact of the matter is that the philosopher that ' s a strange thing to be quoting Conte at a political event
Russian aggression by what we did to impose sanctions and you know building a club the global coalition to defeat Isis it wasn ' t just you know so you know I I think Nicky it ' s about not being nostalgic about what we did but understand how and why we did it we did it through really serious serious coordination and disagreement and and sometimes consensus and sometimes it was really tough but we didn ' t do it in public you know I had a dad who I have
That ’ s why we seized the possibility of moving beyond the decades of conflict in Iran to lock in a nuclear agreement .
compensation that way 90 percent of their compensation I said guess it goes that way what is it what are we doing what ' s happened to us folks speaking over time I think is long long long time that there ' s a minimum wage of $ 15 an hour no I really mean it I mean look folks it ' s uh you know we listen let ' s talk about which you have a right to know what I ' ll do as president my plan my goal is the reward work not just wealth the first step is we have to deal
cartoon hanging to my office that came out of the New Yorker and I had it hanging him off as when I was vice president I ' m kept it in my office as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and it sits there and it ' s a picture of a big road ton guy sitting at a table looks like he ' s being interrogated and on the table there was a burlap bag with a dollar sign on it and he ' s looking at his interrogator and he ' s saying I ' m sorry how was I supposed
As the world ’ s two largest economies , our fates are unavoidably intertwined . President Obama and I have made pragmatic choices that center our relationship with China in enhanced cooperation and responsible competition .
for this this is not a deal guess what if we invest that the money we need and I understand I heard no way out that there ' s been an agreement on a on an infrastructure bill among the least in principle between the president and the Democratic leadership in the Congress we ' ll see but guess what guess what it creates millions and millions of jobs good decent paying jobs folks look as I said we can do all that we need to
as a single nation and you know NATO has always been the platform from which we ' ve been able as United States and individual European countries and Europe United to respond to whatever the crisis worse you know we and you know and there ' s a way to deal with it ' s not always easy you know all these crises affect each of our countries slightly differently some more acutely than others but they affect us all and sometimes it ' s hard to generate a
We ’ ve heard it so often , it ’ s almost a cliché . But it ’ s who we are . We haven ’ t always lived up to these ideals ; Jefferson himself didn ’ t . But we have never before walked away from them .
We drew on all our strengths , from our military , to our health and developmental professionals . With tireless diplomacy , we brought the world along with us . And we saved hundreds of thousands of lives .
First , seizing the possibilities that exist on both sides of the Pacific .
And here ’ s the response I get the last four years that I never ever , ever got before . They grab my hand and say , but , Mr . Vice President , can you deliver ? Let me say it again : Can you deliver ?
Because every single time friend , foe , or agnostic with whom we deal , when you make a deal , it requires them to take a chance . Translated into everyday English from Wilmington , Delaware , as , look , don ’ t ask me to walk out on this limb and take a political hit — even in a dictatorship — unless you assure me . I don ’ t doubt you . I don ’ t doubt the President . But can you get it done in Washington ?
while the rest of the world and competing with us is waging a war for the future ladies and gentlemen we can ' t afford four more years of this kenta four more years of a president who abuses the power of the presidency and most of all most of all we can ' t afford four more years of a president whose entire agenda has been to divide the country to split us to make us be we have to talk about unity we have to bring people back together again
This brings me to the third and final point I ’ d like to make : The imperative for the next President to deal with complex transnational threats — because in our hyper - connected world , events anywhere can impact everywhere .
And so on the assignments I ’ ve been given over the last seven years , when I get sent to meet with a head of state , trying to convince them of a particular position , if we reach agreement , I literally — and Joe is with me a lot , and I ’ ve been with Joe a lot — I reach across the table and shake hands .
have to finish that job so that we no longer have an argue about whether or not health care is a privilege or a right it should be a right for every American look because most of all it gives people and people moms and dads the families a peace of mind remember my mom saying dad goes to bed after he lost a particular job where he lost his health care he said he staring at the ceiling going to bed what happens what happens if I
son Beau my son Beau was diagnosed with a terminal disease he knew we knew the chances were close to zero I couldn ' t imagine if we he didn ' t have insurance if he hadn ' t been a military man and had the coverage he had I can ' t imagine what it would have been like if they said about six months into his year or fighting for his life said no no you ' re outrun your insurance we can ' t do any more talk about dignity being stripped from you or education I can ' t
votes to pass legislation that would prevent the United States from withdrawing from NATO there ' s overwhelming consensus among the political elected officials in both political parties and there ' s no doubt that the United States is prepared to inhabit the leadership role in the 21 st century that we have so long filled on a global stage and indeed a role that the world I think presumptious me say I hope it doesn ' t come out the wrong way but I
Democrats are a rare commodity and I can assure you that the American people the ultimate wellspring of power in the United States of America remain committed to engaging the world with decency and respect that is the prevailing view among the American people to strengthening an advantage such as strengthening and advancing our hard - earned position as a leader of the free world the vast majority of Americans are proud of that
While foreign funding of campaigns is prohibited by federal statute , the body that enforces campaign finance laws – the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) – lacks both teeth and resources . Sophisticated adversaries like Russia and China know how to bypass the ban on foreign funding by exploiting loopholes in the system and using layers of proxies to mask their activities , making it difficult for the FEC , the FBI , and the Treasury Department ’ s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to follow the money .
of our allies that returned benefits to us many times over new markets for our products new new partners to meet complex global challenges new allies to deter aggression and to fight with us if in fact deterrence failed and it ' s still true today when terrorist organizations threaten the safety American citizens were able to ensure our own security because we do not fight them alone we fight them with you our oldest closest allies and
Rather than building from a narrative of freedom and democracy that inspires nations to rally together , this White House casts global affairs as a zero - sum competition — for the United States to succeed , others must lose . Among the many problems that plague the Trump administration ’ s foreign policy , this line of thinking is perhaps the most disturbing .
Terrorism and violent extremism are yet another example of the virulent transnational dangers that requires sustained global response . Al - Qaeda , ISIL , other offshoots , they ’ re real threats .
it is the heart of our collective security it ' s the basis upon which the United States is able to exercise its responsibilities in other parts of the world as well without a stable Atlantic Alliance everything in my view falls apart and I strongly strongly as I guess the majority of my colleagues I don ' t want to speak for anyone but my guess is they do as well believe and support the European Union strongly support the European Union an antidote to excessive
to know he was a job creator come on man job Craner they used to be today my Republican friends and corporate America has adopted the notion that the only responsibility corporations have are to their shareholders that ' s so much malarkey it ' s just not true the fact of the matter is they have obligations they ' ve had in the past obligations to their workers to the employees of the community they live in to the environment the folks
thing I ' m going to focus on is we need much more education and we need to deal with quite frankly the end of the Trump devos education agenda and I don ' t think there ' s any state in America understands that better than Iowa I remember with kids you know everybody took the Iowa test you were the proudest no I ' m sure you were proud incredibly proud but look like Republican governors here as well as
To divert just a second , Michelle said , I like Yeats . And I do . Well , this is the 100 th anniversary of the Rising on Easter Sunday . And there is a line in his poem called Easter Sunday 1917 [ sic *] that goes like this , and he ’ s trying to describe his Ireland at the moment . He said , “ All ’ s changed ; changed utterly . A terrible beauty has been born .”
So today I ’ d like to take a little bit of time to describe to the world from where I sit 100 feet from the Oval Office and the stakes of the choices that lie ahead .
guys are deficit hawks right they increase the deficit by one trillion nine hundred billion dollars of Mexico now what are they using for their now coming along and saying you know we got to deal with that deficit in the Republican Congress the Senate and the Republic ' s in the house you know we have to do we have to we have to deal with taking on those those so that social safety net that ' s costing us too much not a joke here ' s what they ' re saying if
Imagine Central America , democratic and secure . Imagine what it will mean to the hemisphere if that is able to be accomplished .
and then all the all events and floors were collapsing it was so thick you couldn ' t even see in the windows and they came and they got my wife and and they also saved my home and they risked their lives doing it you know the law enforcement the emergency service people firefighters they ' re the only people who run into danger voluntarily and they ' re an incredible breed of cat man I want to tell you there ' s something else so I want to say
We remain the world ’ s leading economic power , and we will for some time . The next President has a tremendous opportunity to finish what was started , to amp up our rate of economic growth , and bring economic resurgence home to Americans all across the nation . We know how to grow the economy . We ’ ve done it before . Invest in education , job training , infrastructure . It ’ s not magic .
In Iraq and Syria , we ’ ve built a 66 - nation coalition to train local forces . And we ’ ve carried out more than 13 , 000 airstrikes . We ’ ve provided afflicted communities with billions in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance .
well I ' m not going to give up on them the United States will never give on our and give up on our allies we need you and I hope you think you need us thank you very much for listening mr . vice president thank you we needed to hear that speech thank you very much you and I had a brief discussion about NATO behind the scenes here ambassador Doug lute your ambassador President Obama ' s ambassador of NATO and
overwhelmingly to be sure there ' s anxiety about what the future holds and caution about what our rapidly changing world means to families who are being left behind you see the same things in your countries as well this fund this fourth Industrial Revolution is causing great anxiety and I think it ' s part of the reason for so much of our uncertainty but their answers which I will not go into today but the fact of the matter is the America I see is not
cannot speak today as an elected government official who ' s able to set policy I can ' t speak as a citizen I can speak as a citizen I can offer insight into my country I ' ve spent the better part of the last two years traveling throughout the United States of America from Minnesota to Texas from Boston to Birmingham I spent time talking and listening to Americans and strong halls of liberal progressivism and in places where
That ’ s why today I ’ m announcing my candidacy for President of the United States .
still waging an act of war today in each case we ' re seeing more than just jockeying for geopolitical advantage in my view there ' s an ideological struggle as well that ' s going on a competition of systems competition of values it ' s the kind of competition that our transatlantic community our institutions and NATO itself was built to address at the end of World War two and yet in this environment for the first time in my memory we ' re being held back by
If economies in Latin America aren ’ t growing because of corruption , if rampant violence drives people from their homes to seek safety elsewhere , or if autocrats undermine democratic institutions and abuse human rights in their countries , it affects us too . Refusing to lead — closing our border , hiding behind walls , pulling back from the region — will do nothing to help these countries address the root of these problems .
And we stand firm when we have real disagreements over issues like human rights , trade and investment , regional security . The next administration will also have to navigate the relationship with China marked at times by breakthrough cooperation and intense cooperation — competition . Sometimes , as with the mounting threat from North Korea , cooperation and competition with China will coexist . The notion that it will be all one or all the other is short - sighted and self - defeating .
And today I ’ m here to speak about a question that ’ s paramount in all of our minds , and that is : How should the next President handle the national security inheritance of the Obama administration that will be passed along in January ?
president along with the secretary of of Labor and along with the Secretary of Commerce we ask them what do they need most they said we need a more educated workforce come on man more educated workforce we know how to do that and give people an opportunity to get the education they need and I ' m talking about post high school I ' m talking about trade school I ' m talking about short term programs I ' m talking about being able of people to work with their hands
There are 1 . 4 billion Muslims in the world . Some of the rhetoric I ’ m hearing sounds designed to radicalize all 1 . 4 billion .
changing world to mitigate their downsides and turn them to our collective advantage the America I see and I mean is sincerely meeting some of a bottom my heart I think that ' s why I ' m I ' m assuming that ' s why so many members of Congress are here today America I see cherishes a free press democracy the rule of law it stands up to the aggression of dictators and against strongmen who ruled by coercion corruption and violence
Meanwhile , our moves to strengthen our European alliance and bolster NATO continue to provide a bulwark against further Russian aggression . For years , we ’ ve encouraged Europe to spend more on defense , diversify their sources and supplies of energy . And now we ’ re starting to see some progress on these fronts , and these efforts have to continue . But there ’ s a lot of work to do .
From the Marshall Plan after World War II to our alliances in East Asia , both Republican and Democratic officials have long embraced a vision of American leadership that fosters a more secure , inclusive and generous planet . That ideal made the world safer and more prosperous — for Americans and everyone else .
gum at the same time we we ' ve been able to do that in the past Richard Burton led the effort you know III mean it sincerely in terms of dealing with Russia in terms of strategic doctrine we were able to we had great difficulty then it was a Soviet Union so look but again I don ' t think we should give up give up on the Russian people I think we have to keep investing in everything from student exchanges to a whole range of issues to let the Russian people know
Trump wins in 2020 I guarantee you I guarantee you that Medicare and Medicaid is social security ground the chopping block there ' s been no question about that in terms of what the majority leader the United States senators said we can ' t let that happen you earned those rights you earned them the folks we need to get rid of this capital gains loophole for the super wealthy look why do we reward investment
With those words , the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it . And in that moment , I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime .
But I think with smart , sustained and steady American leadership , we can seize the opportunities that are existing and leave a more peaceful and more prosperous future to our children and grandchildren . And I really , truly believe that .
At the same time , these terrorists cannot destroy the United States . They cannot bring down our civilization . We should never underestimate America ’ s strength or dismiss the inherent resilience of the American people . President Obama has never hesitated to use force to defend the American people when necessary .
to have an expression for real he ' d say Joey and jobs about a lot more than a paycheck it ' s about your dignity it ' s about respect it ' s about your place in the community it ' s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say honey it ' s gonna be okay but think of all the people today who don ' t think they can say that to their kids but today and I went around the country things have changed I think
We ’ ll not only hold their leaders accountable for reducing carbon output at home in their country , but make sure they stop financing billions of dollars of dirty fossil fuel projects all across Asia — And this will allow us to keep creating good - paying jobs right here at home , even as we raise our own standards . America once again will be able to stand proudly on the world stage And challenge every other nation to follow our example and our leadership . For more than three decades , I have led on this issue . I wrote one of the first climate change bills ever introduced in the United States Senate . As Vice President , I oversaw the single largest investment in clean energy in our nation ’ s history – over $ 90 billion . I fought along with President Obama to double the efficiency of our cars — Which would reduce our oil consumption by 12 billion barrels ,
The core values of this nation , our standing in the world , our very democracy , everything that has made America , America , is at stake .
better expand our capacities deter and meet threats including those you to this century and part of that has to be looking for opportunities to cooperate with Democratic partners beyond North America and beyond Europe the free world is going to be called upon to do more than ever before taking on the new challenges of cyberspace addressing technologies like artificial intelligence would evolve more rapidly
Between 2014 - 2016 , I visited Guatemala three times to support the work of the UN - backed anti - corruption commission in Guatemala , known as CICIG . I made it clear that U . S . funding for Guatemala hinged on CICIG being allowed to continue its work . In fact , when former Guatemalan President Otto Pérez Molina was subsequently arrested on corruption charges brought by CICIG , he blamed me . Our administration ’ s support — and intense personal engagement with regional leaders — was critical . For the first time , the people of Guatemala began to feel like no one was above the law .
Nowhere is this more pointed than in our relationship with China .
Let me start by making a couple things clear . One , the world in which we live today is considerably more complex and interconnected than it was a quarter of a century ago when the Cold War ended , to state the obvious . It is arguably more complex than it was even 15 years ago after 9 / 11 . But at the same time , despite the complexities and the proliferation of new challenges , by almost any measure , the United States is stronger and more secure today than when President Obama and I took office in — January 20 , 2009 .
Russia must uphold its commitments under the Minsk agreement . There can be no backing away from that . And sanctions should remain until they do .
and folks we give all Americans the opportunity to provide for themselves and their families being part of the middle class and one more thing I know I ' m called middle class Joey talking about a lot of snot men as a compliments man I ' m not sophisticated but I tell you what I ' m pretty darn sophisticated Oh know how we have kept unlike any of the nation in tough times our political or economic
We have all the authorities necessary to hold Iran to account . Our targeted sanctions against their ballistic missile program , their support of terrorism , their human rights violations remain firmly in place . The past seven - an - a - half years have shown time and time again that a forward - leaning engagement with the world pays huge dividends .
rapidly it ' s so easy to demagogue the change that are taking place by blaming the other by getting ourselves in the situation where we divide ourselves and so you know III think we have to reduce our vulnerabilities as well you know we could be doing a great deal more on cyber we could be doing a great deal more both at home and abroad in dealing with everything from guaranteeing our undersea capability as well as space I mean there ' s a lot of things that we
