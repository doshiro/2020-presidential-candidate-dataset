Make no mistake - Nicolas Maduro is a repressive and corrupt dictator who is responsible for an unfathomable humanitarian crisis .

trade policy so - called bite wheat based on unilateral action formed from a fragile ego that has as you all know our farmers here in this state and other places looking at bankruptcy because of course we ' ve got soybeans rotting in bins why because folks took the time to invest at least over a decade in a market to sell to China which has now been cut off he has betrayed people betrayed people when he said he was going to come in and help people in

In my administration , labor and civil society groups will always have a seat at the table to ensure that trade agreements do achieve these important objectives . And I think that ' s exactly what we need - pro - labor , pro - environment trade deals - because it ' s clear Donald Trump ' s protectionist approach has been a disaster . His trade war is crushing American farmers , killing American jobs , and punishing American consumers . I would work with our allies in Europe and Asia to confront China on its troubling trade practices , not perpetuate Trump ' s failing tariff war that is being paid for by hard - working Americans .
this is I was raised my sister and I we were raised by a mother who was all five feet tall but if you had ever met her you would have thought she was seven feet tall and our mother was the kind of parent who when you came home complaining about something my mother would look at you and she ' d ask okay so what are you gonna do about it so I decided to run for president United States

The greatest U . S . foreign policy accomplishment has been the post - war community of international institutions , laws , and democratic nations we helped to build . For generations , presidents from both parties established a network of stalwart partners . These countries have contributed to our prosperity and worked with us in war and peace to deal with some of the toughest international crises and to confront a number of generational challenges .
meeting you said to me hey Connolly you know this issue of teacher pay you ' ve been talking about it ' s a national issue and it was because of the conversation that we had that as my first policy proposal I am prepared to make the first federal investment in the history of our country in closing that teacher pay gap I thank you and so that ' s just that ' s part of the backbone part of the backbone of what I believe needs to be done right now which is to make the case
help get my family member off their opioid addiction the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and so as we march on as we march forward I would ask us to hold on to that strength and I would ask us to also remember that one of the greatest strengths of who we are as a nation is that by our nature and character we are aspirational we are a nation that was founded on noble ideals those ideals that were present when we wrote the
We should also play a leadership role in compelling international institutions to use their leverage to end subsidies for dirty fuel . And we should invest heavily in clean energy R & D and advanced energy storage and bringing the transformative technologies that have already been developed right here in the U .

I intend to do everything in my power to fight to take action in Washington , as I ' ve been doing since you helped send me to the Senate . But I need you to get involved in your local community to pressure your elected officials to take common sense and meaningful steps to reduce carbon pollution and address climate change . If the White House is going to stand in the way of real progress , then we have to create it ourselves .

in our nation ' s history
the elected District Attorney of San Francisco , meant
For too long , we have been governed by lawmakers who are beholden to big oil and big coal . They have refused to act on climate change . So it ' s on us to speak the truth , rooted in science fact , not science fiction .

only prosecute the case against Donald Trump in four more years of his administration but who can unify our country knowing how much we have in common and how that has always been the source of not only our strength but our standing in the world because truly even if the outcome of November of 2016 had been different we would still be at a point in time where we would be challenged in the face of all that is in flux around our globe we would still be

And finally , remember that it will be a four year process to withdraw from the Paris Accords . That means that every single time you head to the ballot box between now and then , climate is on the ballot . Your family ' s future is on the ballot . And our ability to save our planet is on the ballot .
years ago as a young District Attorney I walked into the courtroom for the first time and said the five words that would guide my life ' s work Kamala Harris for the people now now I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed but I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on people ' s lives and its responsibility to give them safety and dignity I knew I wanted to protect people and I knew that the people in our society who are most

Let me start by saying this : I guarantee you I won ' t be exchanging love letters with Kim Jong - un . President Trump has handed Kim one PR victory after the next , all without securing any real concessions , so the next president will have serious work to do .
guy who came in and has been in office using the power of the voice of the President of the United States in a way that has been about trying to do to us in a way that has been about trying to sow hate and division among us but see we know that one of the greatest strengths about who we are as a people is in our core in our heart we know we all have so much more in common than what separates us so we ' re not gonna buy what he ' s trying to sell because we know
introduction and our longstanding friendship you know our mothers were friends together also here in Oakland and I can ' t thank you Olivia enough for your leadership and your friendship so here we are here we are let me tell you I am so proud to be a daughter of Oakland California and as most of you know I was born just a throat at Kaiser hospital and it was just a few miles away that my parents

The Green New Deal is a bold plan to drastically shift our country to 100 % clean and renewable energy . We will repair our country ' s crumbling infrastructure , upgrade buildings across the nation , and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions .
truth so let ' s speak some truth let ' s be truth about our economy our economy today is not working for working people the cost of living is going up but paychecks aren ' t keeping up for so many Americans a decent retirement feels out of reach and the American Dream feels out of touch the truth is our people are drowning in debt record student loan debt car loan debt credit
of their school and America where we have a president of the United States who knows it is a sign of strength not to beat people down but to lift people up so I like to tell you a little bit about my background so I was raised as a child as a daughter of the civil rights movement my parents met when they were active in that movement my sister and I joked that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting in fact our mother
to oil companies like Chevron and mobile while hurting the Iowa Renewable Fuels across the state yeah what would the Harris presidency look like as far as sres in the RFS it ' s they would not benefit and so the the RFS are renewable fuel standards have got to go back to a place where it is about recognizing that the the folks who were here in Iowa and not the big oil companies that is not what it was designed to do and he ' s been giving exemptions to them and so that
forces and voices that are trying to sow hate and division among us and I think that when we see that and we know it ' s happening we must speak a fundamental truth and we must speak it from our hearts we must speak it from our souls and that truth in the face of those who are trying to divide us is this the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and we must speak that truth and we must own that truth and we must not allow people
to fight against those who have been trying to push hate and division among us and have Americans turn on each other . To win , we are gonna have to fight for what I know in my heart and in my soul to be true , which is in the beauty of the diversity of who we are as a nation .
to get away with selling that stuff they ' re trying to sell in their effort to divide us which is their effort to have us lose our strength let ' s not buy that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and here ' s how I think about it I think about it based on what I call the middle of the night thought some people refer to it as the three in the morning thought you know others refer to that as the witching hour you know I ' m talking
tell you why well first of all because as a prosecutor I have personally heard more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you as the Attorney General of California where I ran the second largest department of justice in the United States I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you I have seen as someone who has prosecuted prosecuted homicide cases while autopsy photographs and I care to tell you so background checks why well
gangs let ' s be perfectly clear the president ' s medieval vanity project is not going to stop them and in the fight for the people to hold this administration accountable I have seen the amazing spirit of the American people during the healthcare fight I saw parents and children with grave illnesses walk the halls of the United States Congress families who had traveled across the country at
Americans can I get a job keep it job pay the bills by the end of the month retire with dignity for students can I pay off those student loans for so many families Iowa knows this that can I help my family member get off their opioid or their drug addiction for so many of the seniors in our country do I have to make a choice between whether I fill my prescription I fill my refrigerator the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and so
be made to fight alone .
that is about all of us because yes , a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us and here ' s the bottom line , Iowa . Here ' s the bottom line . I do believe , I do believe
Constitution of the United States and all of its amendments and the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence and those words we spoke in 1776 that we are all and should be treated as equals we are aspirational by nature we are also clear - eyed we ' ve not yet reached those ideals but our strength is that we fight to get there and so I say fight we will and we will fight knowing what can be unburdened by what has been we will fight knowing that
were many of us of course required a question again exactly for whom and for all of us made it clear he was talking about going back to something so that required us to ask back to what back before the Voting Rights Act back before the Civil Rights Act back before row v Wade back before the ABA cuz we ' re not going back we ' re not going back no Lima and deeds gotta go so an Oliver dude to go we will need to successfully

when we wake up at 3 o ' clock in the morning that thought is never occurring to us through the lens of the party with which were registered to vote when we wake up thinking that thought it is never through the lens of some demographic some pollster put us in and for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought it usually has to do with one of just a very few things our personal health the health of our children our parents for so many

And for the people , when I stood there , and when I stand here today ,
Trump ' s decision is a tragic one with catastrophic repercussions for our kids and our grandkids . The justifications for this are irrational and fake at best . Trump himself has called climate change a " Chinese hoax ."
conversation so let ' s speak some truth in our country and labour has been doing it and does it every day let ' s speak truth America ' s economy is not working for working people let ' s speak that true and how do we know it to be true well in America right now today almost half of American families are $ 400 . 00 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval $ 400 unexpected expense that could be the car breaking down that could be a hospital bill you didn ' t see coming
it we got a look at the fact that we have got to invest in the American people and American families and working families and this is one of the most critical issues facing working families in America which is affordable childcare yeah thank you you talked about how Trump ' s been hurting the Iowan farmers one of the other things that his administration ' s done is ramped up the small refinery exemptions giving breaks
The United States and Saudi Arabia still have mutual areas of interest , such as counterterrorism , where the Saudis have been strong partners . And we should continue to coordinate on that front .

and this is a fight
That ' s why I ' m running , for the people . - For the people , for

that is why when a case is filed it doesn ' t read the name of the victim it reads the people and this is a point I have often explained to console and counsel survivors of crime people who faced great harm often at the hands of someone they trust be it a relative or a bank or a big corporation I would remind them you are not invisible we all stand together because that is the power of the people and my whole life I ' ve only had one client the people

leaders have got to lead and leaders lead and now you look up in the sky is blue because we put in place rules around greenhouse gas emissions as so many others I ' ve seen what is capable and what is possible when we change human behaviors in a way that does not require much change to our lifestyle but we ' ll save this planet God gave us and so I know what is possible but it ' s a matter of leadership and it ' s also a matter of holding the polluters
