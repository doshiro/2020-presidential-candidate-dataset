the Kurds for slaughter and allowing Russia to fill the void how that makes America great again and I am still waiting to find out when he is asked by a reporter at the g 20 about invasion in our own elections by Russia he turns to flat amir putin on the world stage in front of everyone ' s watching and makes a joke about it that doesn ' t make America great again that makes Russia great again that ' s what he ' s doing and I ' m telling you
Combating Russian aggression . Our intelligence agencies have confirmed that the Kremlin used cyberattacks , espionage , and propaganda to undermine the 2016 election , including attempts to hack into the election systems of at least 21 states . Russia didn ’ t just try to hack into our election systems . They also launched an extended information war designed to divide our country and destroy Americans ’ confidence in our political system . Top intelligence officials have confirmed Russia interfered in our election , and is currently working to undermine upcoming elections . When we learned that foreign entities were using American social media platforms to conduct foreign influence campaigns during the 2016 election , I introduced the Honest Ads Act with former Senator John McCain of Arizona and Senator Warner of Virginia to strengthen accountability and transparency by holding political ads sold online to the same standards currently in place for TV and radio . I also introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Blunt of Missouri to help protect our elections from foreign influence by requiring federal campaigns and political groups to verify that online credit card donations come from U . S . sources . In addition , in 2017 I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Lankford of Oklahoma , Senator Harris of California , and Senator Graham of South Carolina to provide states with the resources to better protect their election systems from cyber - attacks . Resources to make election security improvements , implement cybersecurity guidelines , and replace outdated electronic voting machines were signed into law in March of 2018 .
Antitrust fees that are paid when companies file proposed mergers for review and allow the government to exercise and pursue cases have not kept up with the times .
Remaining vigilant against terrorism . Since 9 / 11 , we have made significant improvements to our counterterrorism and intelligence capabilities . However , recent terror attacks and attempted attacks at home and abroad show that terrorists remain intent on causing us harm . Our military forces and intelligence agencies must continue to go after terrorists , including working with our allies to defeat our enemies . We must continue to develop new technology to detect and mitigate threats to our nation by air , land , and sea . We must also strengthen our federal , state , and local intelligence and law enforcement operations and streamline coordination between our national security agencies . By strengthening our security efforts at home and investing in efforts that help prevent terrorist ideologies from developing , we can diminish the threat of terrorism to our nation .
End the sale of junk insurance policies that eliminate existing protections for consumers . Senator Klobuchar will end efforts to provide short - term junk insurance that eliminates existing protections for consumers like protections for people with pre - existing conditions and Affordable Care Act requirements to cover essential health benefits .
Outline a plan to cut childhood poverty in half in ten years and end it within a generation . Senator Klobuchar will put forward a plan to cut childhood poverty in half in ten years , including expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit , the Child Care Tax Credit , SNAP benefits and overhauling our country ’ s housing policy .
End the travel ban . Senator Klobuchar will put an end to the administration ’ s travel ban , recognizing that immigrants don ’ t diminish America , they are America . While security and vetting should stay in place , the Trump Administration ’ s ban was wrong .
Strengthening support for victims of military sexual assault . Despite increasing awareness of the problem of sexual assault within our Armed Forces , the Department of Defense had no unified system in place to ensure storage of assault victims ’ medical and forensic records . That ’ s why I authored the Support for Survivors Act to ensure lifelong preservation of victims ’ records so they are able to seek care and justice for the trauma they have experienced . All of the women senators of both parties cosponsored this bill and its major provisions were signed into law in December 2011 . In 2012 , I introduced the bipartisan Military Sexual Assault Prevention Act with former Senator Olympia Snowe to improve tracking and review of sexual assault claims in the military and help ensure victims can get the justice they deserve . Key provisions from this bill – those requiring retention of records , enhanced reporting on military sexual assault , and an established Defense Department policy against sexual harassment – were incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 , which became law in January 2013 .
We will also hold the nominees to the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission to these same high standards .
Since 2008 , American firms have engaged in $ 10 trillion in acquisitions . And over the last five years , there was a 50 percent increase in mergers reviewed by the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice Antitrust Division .
because I know some of this foreign policy stuff seems far and far away but it ' s not it ' s really what we stand for you think of those veterans thousands and thousands of through the years have lost standing up for our democracy and democracies around the world think about the greatest generation they stood up for what ' s right and for human rights and for democracy think about those four little girls who lost their life in that Church
Protecting consumers from unsafe wood imports and supporting our timber producers . I authored the bipartisan Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Act , signed into law in 2009 , to protect consumers from potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde in composite wood products and to ensure the U . S . timber industry is on a level playing field with foreign competitors . I continue to push the Environmental Protection Agency to fully implement this law and hold importers accountable and keep our families safe . I have also testified at the International Trade Commission to press for cracking down on unfair subsidization of paper imports from Canada , China , and other countries around the world . I introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Daines from Montana to improve the health of our nation ’ s forests and reduce the risk of wildfire on federal , state , county , tribal , and private lands in proximity to one another . This bill will improve water quality , protect wildlife habitat , and enhance opportunities for the production of wood products .
Expanding the market for homegrown biofuels . As a member of the Senate Commerce and Agriculture Committees , I worked on the bipartisan bill to ensure that the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 included provisions requiring a significant increase in biofuel production by the year 2022 . This law also included new provisions to promote biofuel infrastructure and the installation of blender pumps at gas stations across the country , which will provide consumers with the choice of using higher blends of ethanol . USDA announced in 2015 that Minnesota would receive support to install approximately 620 pumps – the third most of all states receiving grant money . The investment will boost local economies across Minnesota , give drivers more choices at the pump and reduce dependence on foreign oil . As a member of the Farm Bill conference committee , I worked to ensure the 2014 Farm Bill included a strong energy title to allow our farmers to continue to develop homegrown energy for our nation . I am also pushing to maintain a strong Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS ) that will help drive innovation and boost Minnesota ’ s economy while reducing our dependence on foreign oil . In recent years and under both Republican and Democratic administrations the EPA has proposed changes to the RFS that would hurt the biofuels industry by lowering the biofuels targets , discouraging investment and hurting jobs in rural communities across the country . I led meetings between Senators of both parties and former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to urge the Obama Administration to reverse the changes and maintain a strong RFS . I have consistently led bipartisan letters with Senator Chuck Grassley calling for a strong RFS .
Connect more families to housing in higher opportunity neighborhoods . Senator Klobuchar would expand the pilot for mobility housing vouchers that allow families with children to use their vouchers in higher opportunity neighborhoods .
Restore disclosure rules that counter workers ’ organizing efforts . Senator Klobuchar will restore a rule rescinded by President Trump mandating public disclosure when employers hire consultants to counter workers ’ union organizing efforts .
uncomfortable this is what I meant now John and I when I first think are amazing an incredible team and staff for putting this together also the city of Minneapolis parks thank you all the incredible people that turned out my friends Tina Smith and governor walls Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan highest - ranking Native American state official in our nation our congressional delegation thank you mayors commissioners legislators oh I forgot my
Prevent abuses by IRS private debt collectors . Reports suggest that the IRS private debt collectors have abused and harassed low - income taxpayers whose tax debts are relatively small . Senator Klobuchar will overhaul the program and limit these abuses .
One big solution is obvious : More aggressive antitrust enforcement to prevent concentration and monopolies .
During the campaign , then - Candidate Trump ’ s rhetoric echoed former President Teddy Roosevelt . He even talked about “ too much concentration of power in the hands of too few .”
Strengthening the Clean Air Act . I was an original cosponsor of the bipartisan Clean Air Act Amendments of 2010 that would require power plants to cut air pollution – such as mercury and ozone emissions – by 50 to 90 percent over the next five years . I also voted against an amendment that would have blocked the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) from moving forward with the Cross State Air Pollution rule that helps protect Minnesotans from power plant pollution from other states . I also fought against attempts in the Senate to undermine the Clean Air Act and invalidate the standards that reduce pollution from mercury and other hazardous chemicals . I have opposed this Administration ’ s attempts to delay and reverse oil and gas methane pollution standards .
way I believe in the truth and facts it ' s a very important part about me that you need to know that maybe you saw on that debate stage so when you look at the facts what happened in 2018 we came roaring back sherrod Brown won that Senate seat in Ohio with really no problem we won in Pennsylvania of the governor the senator we won in Michigan with a new woman governor by the way whose slogan was fix the damn roads very direct okay we want in Wisconsin and if
Aggressively combat illegal Chinese steel dumping . Senator Klobuchar will ensure the federal government is aggressively combating illegal Chinese steel dumping including through expanded personnel to enforce our trade laws and increased inspections of steel imports at ports of entry . She will also direct the U . S . Department of Labor to expedite approval of Trade Adjustment Assistance petitions for workers from the affected mining operations .
Stop Trump sabotage of the ACA by ending workarounds that allow states to raise premiums for sicker people and shift ACA premium subsidies away from lower - income enrollees . Senator Klobuchar will eliminate the Trump Administration guidance that provides states more flexibility to increase insurance costs for sicker people and shift premium subsidies away from low - income enrollees .
Reducing our dependence on foreign oil . Our national security is in part dependent on oil - producing nations whose policies and objectives often diverge from our own . Fostering stable and sustainable homegrown energy sources has great potential to increase our national security . Our energy agenda should include biofuels , wind power , solar , and other sources of renewable energy , in addition to domestic oil drilling , natural gas , hydropower , nuclear , geothermal , and waste - to - energy technology . Minnesotans know that the renewable fuels industry creates good jobs and strengthens our economy , in addition to reducing our dependence on foreign oil . We should be investing in the farmers and workers of the Midwest , not the oil cartels of the Middle East .
off his parents health insurance three days short of his pay day Alec a diabetic wasn ' t able to afford his insulin he tried rationing it to save money it didn ' t work and he died this disgrace should never happen in the United States of America not with a simple drug that ' s been around for nearly a century the obstacle to change the big pharma companies think they own Washington well they don ' t own me and they don ' t
Supporting Children of the National Guard and Reserve . More than one million military - connected children face challenges associated with service , including frequent moves , parental deployments , and other issues related to parents in the service . I have introduced legislation that ensures children of our guard and reserve servicemembers are identified as students of military families in school records . This requirement would help ensure that schools and teachers know which students have parents in the military and help accommodate those needs . This already applies to children of active duty servicemembers and it must be applied to the National Guard and Reserve .
Develop best models of care to address disparities in maternal and infant mortality and address the shortage of maternity care health professional in underserved rural and urban areas . Senator Klobuchar will immediately implement a new law that tackles the shortage of maternity care health professionals — including nurses , midwives , and obstetricians — in underserved areas , and she will develop best models of care to address racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality .
it easier for workers to afford childcare housing and education that is what I mean by shared prosperity but we can ' t get there if people can ' t afford their health care and that means getting to universal health care and bringing down bringing down the cost of prescription drugs last week my guest to the State of the Union who is here with us today was Nicole Smith Holt Nicole ' s son Alec a 26 year - old restaurant manager from the southern suburbs aged
For example , each party is currently required to pay $ 280 , 000 for a deal valued at $ 807 million or more . But even deals of 100 times that size — which demand greater resources — would incur the same fees .
Restore and strengthen overtime rules . Too many American workers have been working overtime without getting paid for the extra hours . Senator Klobuchar will restore and strengthen the Obama Administration ’ s overtime rules to expand overtime pay to millions of workers , increasing the maximum salary for a worker to qualify for the overtime pay they ’ ve earned .
they tell me these stories they cry so it ' s just out when you win there ' s no cameras there by the way um and he started to cry and he talked about for him it was the boy scout rally when he heard Donald Trump politicized the Boy Scouts probably not a lot of people in the country remember that but he did because he was a boy scout and so as he ' s crying in his living room he says to me I still remember that moment and I went and I voted for him in the ballot
Recognizing the unique challenges faced by our National Guard and Reserves . Over the past decades , our citizen - soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves have increasingly been asked to serve in front - line combat positions side - by - side with active duty soldiers . Although we have made many improvements , many steps must still be taken to equalize conditions , equipment , and benefits between active duty troops and National Guard and Reserve troops . The National Guard is the most cost - effective and versatile component of our Armed Forces . We need to ensure that our National Guard has the equipment and training for the full range of international and domestic missions . I have supported legislation to require independent commissions to review Army and Air Force plans that cut National Guard forces . I will continue to fight for the resources the National Guard needs to continue its important role in our nation ’ s defense .
And there ’ s more reason for concern . Like the fact that 83 percent of companies that earned 25 percent profit or more in 2003 were still achieving those profit levels a decade later .
Implementing the first automobile fuel efficiency upgrades in decades . I was part of a bipartisan group of senators that reached a compromise to pass the 2007 Energy Bill , which provided incentives to develop new , more efficient consumer technologies . From the next generation of hybrid and plug - in vehicles , to higher efficiency standards for appliances , to incentives for the design and construction of high - performance energy - efficient buildings , these initiatives are designed to reduce energy bills and save consumers money . I have supported efforts to increase the Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFÉ ) standards and oppose this Administration ’ s efforts to scale them back .
Thank you .
Raise the refugee admissions cap . Under President Trump , the State Department has dramatically lowered the annual cap on the number of refugees that can be resettled in the United States . Senator Klobuchar will direct the State Department to restore the cap to at least its pre - Trump Administration level .
Maintain protest rights on public property in Washington , DC . Senator Klobuchar will end the Trump Administration attempts to limit protest rights in Washington , DC , like closing 80 percent of the White House sidewalk and putting new limits on spontaneous demonstrations .
because he decided to sell out the oil companies and now after the fact just like what Andy mentioned about Syria and the bloodshed there after the fact when he realizes he really screwed up and he tries to fix it he tries to fix it with sanctions after the fact he tries to fix it with throwing a bunch of money at her farmer when what you would really like to do is just farm that ' s what he ' s done or the guy that came up to me in line in Conway New Hampshire yesterday so I want
Cindy and all of your help we turned the House of Representatives back into the people ' s house that is how we win that is how we win in 2020 and that is how we will bring back America and revive the heart of America that is what my campaign is about it is a grassroots effort
Set ambitious goals to reduce the carbon footprint of the federal government . The federal government has a significant carbon footprint . As President , Senator Klobuchar will set ambitious goals to increase the efficiency of federal buildings , data centers , and vehicles , reduce water consumption , and increase the use of renewable energy .
Supporting our National Guard and Reserves . The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have also highlighted the importance of our brave citizen - soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves and the unprecedented sacrifices they have been called upon to make over the past decades . I have been fighting to ensure that our National Guard has the tools and resources it needs to be successful . [ See Veterans section .] I fought to help the Minnesota National Guard host one of the National Guard Cyber Protection Units . Hosting a Cyber Protection Team allows the Minnesota National Guard to serve as a national leader in the fight against cyber terrorism . I helped to bring Active Association status to the Bulldogs of the 148 th Fighter Wing in Duluth . This designation helped ensure the base ’ s long - term future and increased economic activity in the Duluth community . I also fought to get new fighter jets – the “ Block 50 ” F - 16 s – to the 148 th Fighter Wing by working to secure funding to help modernize base facilities and improve infrastructure at the Duluth airport .
End anticompetitive practices that increase the price of prescription drugs . Many pharmaceutical companies have found loopholes in regulations that allow them to block or delay cost - saving competition like refusing to provide samples or share important information about how to distribute a drug safely . As President , Senator Klobuchar will instruct HHS to issue regulations to stop anti - competitive practices and help reduce the cost of prescription drugs .
Support Israel and work toward a two - state solution . Senator Klobuchar believes that Israel is one of America ’ s strongest and most enduring allies and a beacon of democracy in the Middle East . She is committed to fighting for a strong U . S . — Israel relationship and a secure Israel . And she will also get back to a meaningful peace process that combines — not separates — the political and economic tracks , has buy - in from Israelis , Palestinians , and the Arab world , and ultimately leads to direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians themselves that can lead to a two - state solution .
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the importance of our brave citizen - soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves and the unprecedented sacrifices they have been called upon to make over the past decades . The National Guard and Reserves were not built to serve as an active duty force for prolonged periods , yet at times , as many as 40 percent of American forces fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan were Guard and Reserve troops . The repeated mobilizations and overseas deployments of Guard and Reserve units have profoundly affected families and communities in Minnesota and across the nation .
Protect health care workers ’ right to organize . Senator Klobuchar will rescind an anti - union regulatory change enacted by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services that prevents union dues from being deducted from Medicaid - funded paychecks of home health care workers .
Protect LGBTQ people from government - sanctioned discrimination . Senator Klobuchar will stop efforts to give federal protections to those discriminating against LGBTQ people . She will end all efforts by the Department of Justice that argue that transgender people do not have protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act .
Andy is someone who stands up for what he believes he said then quote the time comes when you have to be true to yourself and follow the dictates of your conscience for me that time is now you know what I ' m thinking that maybe I should read that quote in the chamber of the US Senate as we head into certain proceedings and certain decisions that are going to have to be made the time comes when you have to be true to yourself and follow the
Improving veterans ’ health care . Since 2007 I have joined my colleagues in providing record funding increases for military healthcare and to strengthen and improve veterans ’ healthcare programs and services under the Department of Veterans ' Affairs .
get things done so I think you know how high the stakes are you know that this is about changing policies yes but it is also about changing the tone in our politics that means we have to look up from our phones I ' m so glad no one ' s on their phones right now I accept you guys fact that we have to look up from our phones and change the tone in our politics that is what this is about we have to look at each other because we know what these

But , we need the agencies to do more . And we need the new Administration to take this seriously .
Support and strengthen the Economic Development Administration . The Economic Development Administration works directly with communities and regions to promote competitiveness and innovation . It has a proven track record of success and on average every $ 1 of EDA infrastructure funding generates $ 15 in private investment . Still , the Trump Administration repeatedly proposed eliminating the agency . Senator Klobuchar will ensure the agency has the resources to carry out its mission .
I don ’ t have to tell you how important small business growth is to our economy . As firms with fewer than 20 workers make up 90 percent of businesses in our country , the stakes of allowing firms to compete could not be higher .
and number three stand up for civil liberties right we ' ve got a president in the White House that literally tweets whatever he wants every single day but doesn ' t respect the Amendment allow that allows him to do it we don ' t just tolerate the First Amendment we embrace it stand up for an independent judiciary and stop these judges that are trying to take us back to 1972 when women didn ' t have a right to choose what to do with their bodies
But at a meeting with the President - elect , the CEOs of Bayer and Monsanto discussed their $ 66 billion merger , which is currently being reviewed by the Justice Department . After the meeting , the Administration took credit for commitments the companies made to create new jobs and invest in Research and Development .
chief you know dude and I start walking in and all of a sudden I feel this big hand on my shoulder and this voice says I know you ' re gonna do great out there but when they play that song I usually go first well that was my first time there in the White House the Iowa Democrats but it won ' t be my last so I have spent the last few days on a 20 count eat or and after the tragedies of this weekend it reinvigorated me it reinvigorated me as I stood in front of
MCI took on Bell Operating Company and its owner AT & T , and ultimately help break up that monopoly , lowered long - distance prices for consumers across the country , and revolutionized the telecom industry .
Combating North Korean aggression . North Korea ’ s accelerating nuclear and ballistic missile programs pose a serious threat to the United States and our allies and the country ’ s leader , Kim Jong - un , is a ruthless dictator who has committed horrible crimes against his own people . We need a comprehensive strategy on North Korea that includes diplomacy , economic pressure and engagement with our allies in the region . That is why I voted for sanctions against the North Korean government in both 2016 and 2017 . Under these laws , foreign governments that buy or sell defense equipment to North Korea are prohibited from receiving certain U . S . assistance . Our country ’ s financial institutions are prohibited from working with foreign banks that do business with North Korea . These laws also impose sanctions on North Korean cargo and shipping , goods produced by forced labor in North Korea , and people or companies that employ North Korean forced laborers . Unilateral escalation without a plan and without our allies is not in America ’ s best interest . I will continue to work to ensure that we do everything we can with our allies to address the threat posed by North Korea .
Many are also rightfully concerned that conditions the agencies place on mergers often fail and that more deals must be blocked . The FTC vigorously disputes these claims and recently published its own merger retrospective . But even the FTC ’ s own study found a significant number of failed remedies .
Iowa and as you know Andy worked in the state legislature for 24 years as a Republican then he returned 15 years later after his kids were grown and he had retired from his law practice and according to him he found a very different Republican caucus when he returned and I think you ' ve heard that he decided to switch parties and what you may not know is that it runs in his family his great - grandfather was a Democrat who became a Republican
Concentration can also limit innovation . Think of your cable company and the cable box . No one liked the cable box , but for years the cable company made no modifications and continually increased rental fees .
So , we have to recognize the broader benefits of antitrust enforcement . Especially today , when we ’ re living through an unprecedented wave of concentration across industries .
because of the snow but you can text Amy at nine one nine nine zero I don ' t have a political machine I don ' t come from money but what I do have is this I have grit I have family I have friends I have neighbors and I have all of you who are willing to come out in the middle of winter all of you who took the time to watch us today from home all of you who are willing to stand up and say people matter I ' m asking you not to look down
Some people ask , what does a strong economy have to do with antitrust ? And the answer is unexpectedly : Everything . Let me repeat that . Antitrust has everything to do with our broader economy .
Patriots who saw more that United them than divided them and this is how this city the mill city and our country prospered right along this river and our nation ' s railways and roads grounded in the common belief that prosperity shared leads to better lives for all and this is how we became the world ' s beacon of democracy one in which every one matters we start in this place we ' re about a mile down river on a beautiful summer
Reassess the granting of Medicaid waivers , including states that have privatized Medicaid . Senator Klobuchar will conduct a reassessment of the granting of Medicaid waivers for states that wish to privatize the program and impose discriminatory work requirements .
something that you take care of every day a sturdy bridge of our democracy to a higher plane in our politics and we have someone in the White House right now that ' s trying to fracture our sense of community every single day he somehow thinks that organized hate is more powerful than unorganized love whoa maybe he ' s right but how do we respond to that we organize right we organize and that is how we win so here is my background it ' s actually kind of an
Modernizing veterans ’ educational benefits . The Post - 9 / 11 GI Bill , which I cosponsored and which took effect in August 2009 , provides enhanced tuition benefits so that any veteran who serves at least three months on active duty will receive benefits to cover the costs of up to 36 months of higher education , depending on length of service . This critical legislation will help GI Bill benefits keep pace with the rising cost of college , while ensuring that Guard and Reserve members receive educational benefits comparable to those granted to active duty soldiers . I was an original cosponsor of the Forever GI Bill that was signed into law in August of 2017 . That bill ended time limits on use of veteran educational benefits . I also authored the bipartisan Servicemember Student Loan Interest Relief Act to prevent interest from accruing on student loans during deployment and to help ensure servicemembers are not set back financially as a result of their service to our nation .
Trump the science is on my side and I ' d like to see how your hair would fare in a blizzard I announced by that River because I wanted to make the point that I come from the heartland and yes we have snow in the heartland and I don ' t come from money but I have grit you know I got into politics with that grit when our daughter was born and she was really sick she couldn ' t swallow and back then the insurance companies had a rule that they kicked you out of the hospital
actually had a lot money than me and a lot more connections than me and they did it because I ' ve got grit and I know you have that too you look at what you have done since that president got sworn into office the next day millions of people marched all over this world right we march peacefully and we march the next day 6 , 000 women signed up for office and now we ' re up to 30 , 000 on day 10 on day 10 after that mean - spirited a Muslim band that in that
across the country day nine the meze and spirited refugee order people spontaneously showed up at the airport day 100 the March for science my favorite sign what do we want science when do we want it after peer review then the fighting Democrats we stood up against their attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then those students marched against gun violence and they didn ' t just March they voted and then finally last fall with Abby and
war that he won ' t get done and even though he said oh I ' ve negotiated this and this and this what do we find out when he calls the president of China the reports are one of the things he does instead of talking only about the trade war and the house he finds tries once again to find dirt on a pool this is what this guy does or how about the waivers to the big oil companies we have seen plants closed ethanol and biodiesel plants right here in the state of Iowa
Overhaul ethics rules for White House employees and other senior officials . Senator Klobuchar will make clear that the President and Vice President must follow our conflict of interest laws , do more to investigate foreign agents who lobby in the United States , give the Office of Government Ethics more enforcement power , and provide additional protections for all Special Counsels .
Helping Veterans Exposed to Toxic Burn Pits . It took the government years after the Vietnam War to recognize that there was a link between Agent Orange and the devastating health effects on our soldiers . We can ’ t let history repeat itself — burn pits can ’ t become today ’ s Agent Orange . We need to better understand and address the relationship between burn pit exposure and the health needs of our brave men and women in uniform . That ’ s why I introduced legislation with Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina to create a Center of Excellence in the Department of Veterans Affairs focused on researching the health effects associated with burn pits and treating veterans who become sick after exposure . Our bill was signed into law in September 2018 . I am also leading legislation with Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska to require that members of the Armed Forces be evaluated for exposure to toxic airborne chemicals during routine health exams and direct the Secretary of Defense to record whether servicemembers were based or stationed near an open burn pit .
saying to those big pharma companies you know what you might have to lobbyists for every member of Congress you might think that they own Washington but they don ' t own me that is what standing up for America is about so let ' s stand up for our unions and the right to organize because when unions are strong our economy is strong let ' s stand up like the Rangers of Iowa 130 years ago and stand up against monopoly power and let ' s pass a
Invest in adult basic education . Senator Klobuchar will reverse President ’ s Trump proposal to cut basic education programs for adults , and launch an initiative focused on increasing opportunities for adults to master literacy and basic math skills .
Although firms may exploit an advantage in the short - term , winners and losers should change over time in a competitive market . This should be the case in the American economy .
Encourage reinsurance programs . Rather than penalizing states who put reinsurance programs in place , which happened under the Trump Administration , Senator Klobuchar will encourage states to adopt reinsurance programs that stabilize the state ’ s insurance marketplace , lower premiums , and allow more people to access to affordable , quality health care .
Impose full sanctions on Russia for hostile act against the United States and its allies . In 2017 , Congress passed legislation providing additional authorities for the President to impose sanctions on Russia in response to its election interference and other aggressive actions . The Trump Administration has resisted full implementation of these sanctions . Senator Klobuchar will use these authorities to the fullest extent possible to impose serious costs on the Putin regime and its enablers for hostile acts against the United States and our allies .
Commit to strong financial regulation . Senator Klobuchar will rescind Executive Order 13772 , which has allowed the Treasury Department and other financial regulators to weaken critical safeguards put in place after the financial crisis . She will commit to strong financial regulation that levels the playing field and promotes economic stability and growth .
that barn and with the flag and I thought to myself you know what this flag is flying over El Paso today and it is flying over Dayton today and that is because we are one America we are one America and there are not two sides no they ' re not when the other side is the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist there is only one side and that is the American side and I have had so many Iowans approached me about gun safety and about doing something about
Work to re - enter the Iran nuclear agreement . The 2015 nuclear agreement imposed verifiable limits on Iran ’ s nuclear program that would prevent it from building a nuclear weapon . Senator Klobuchar will negotiate to bring the United States back into the nuclear agreement with the goal of avoiding war and a nuclear - armed Iran .
Prosecute unscrupulous payday lenders . Senator Klobuchar will direct the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , the Justice Department and other agencies to prosecute unscrupulous payday lenders that engage in predatory practices and charge customers exorbitant interest rates .
how people like Barack Obama can rise no one thought he was gonna be able to win that race with the name like Barack Obama okay but he did it because he brought people with us and he did it for the right reason and people trusted him right now we have a deficit of trust in this country we have a deficit fiscally that this president make keeps making worse every day we have a deficit when it comes to our world ' s respect but we also have a deficit of trust from our
Reinstate visas for same - sex partners of foreign diplomats . Senator Klobuchar will reverse the Trump Administration policy change of no longer issue family visas to same - sex partners of foreign diplomats or employees of international organizations who work in the United States .
Helping improve programs for homeless veterans . I introduced and passed into law in 2012 the bipartisan Helping Our Homeless Veterans Act to improve programs for homeless veterans – particularly those living in rural areas – to make sure they receive housing and support services to help them get back on their feet . This legislation encourages partnerships between the VA and community providers , building on local expertise to ensure that no veteran slips through the cracks .
The FTC ’ s recent merger retrospective study only covers FTC settlements , and it was the first study since 1999 . We have to do better .
Recently , competition — like Apple TV and Roku — has improved the viewer experience and expanded choice . Competition drives innovation .
These examples are part of a larger pattern . Just last year , then Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Bill Baer , a lifelong antitrust practitioner , said his agency was reviewing deals with such serious antitrust concerns that they should never have made it out of the corporate boardroom .
choices because she ' s made them on her own terms that ring is your faith in politics and then there is Andy who believes in bringing people together not just politically but literally he ' s one as you know he ' s one of Iowa ' s best - known square - dance callers hey I did not know that until today and I got to meet with him and Connie in their home which was just beautiful and I could see how much they cared about not just their home and their family but
Cities of Minneapolis st . Paul we are gathered here today on this beautiful Mississippi River America ' s great river running straight through the middle of our country through the heartland it takes its name from the Native American word for the father of waters it ' s starts small up north and like so many of you as a kid I got the thrill of going up there and claiming that I jumped clear over the Mississippi River it then gets wider as it was down here

across the aisle to get the federal funding and we rebuilt that i - 35 w bridge in just over a year that that ' s community that ' s a shared story that ' s ordinary people doing extraordinary things but my friends that sense of community is fracturing across our nation right now worn down by the petty and vicious nature of our politics we are tired of the shutdowns in the showdowns of the gridlock and the grandstanding today on this know a day
Reforming our nation ’ s toxic chemicals policy . Our country ’ s primary law regulating the production and use of chemicals hadn ’ t been updated since its passage in 1976 . I supported reforms that would keep our children and families safe from toxic substances while providing businesses clear standards for developing new products . I was a cosponsor of the Senate bill that updated the Toxic Substances Control Act , which was signed into law in June 2016 .
End the misguided overuse of secret RFS small refinery waivers that have been granted to big oil companies at the expense of farmers . Senator Klobuchar will completely overhaul the EPA ’ s small refinery waivers and greatly increase transparency , ensuring that RFS waivers meant for small refiners do not go to big oil companies like Chevron and ExxonMobil and that these secret waivers do not line the pockets of big oil companies at the expense of farmers .
These proposals are common - sense solutions that will improve the lives of people across the country , and also by the way , improve capitalism . Capitalism is based on fair play and equal competition . It ’ s based on this idea that you want to have a vibrant system , where small companies can continue to compete and come into the market . If that competition is stifled , it ’ s not only bad for consumers and for America , it is also bad for business . And so , if any of the other reasons don ’ t work here , I hope that will .
At one point early on in my career , my main client was MCI , an aggressive , innovative long - distance telephone company that was determined to disrupt the telecom industry by competing with local monopoly carriers .
University of Minnesota and went on to get to go all over the world because of that degree my mom grew up in Milwaukee the site of our convention in 2020 and she got a teacher ' s degree and she moved to Minnesota why because they had strong teachers unions and she ended up teaching second grade until she was 70 years old and I still have people come up to me and tell me that she was her favorite teacher so I stand before you today as the granddaughter of an iron
Prevent misclassification of workers . Senator Klobuchar will rescind the Department of Labor guidance under the Trump Administration that makes it easier for businesses to misclassify workers , which can result in reduced benefits , lower wages , discrimination , diluted worker protections , and abdications of legal responsibilities .
We must commit ourselves to protecting our environment and preserving our natural resources for generations to come . Environmental conservation is a fundamental part of Minnesota ’ s heritage – and it is part of my own family ’ s heritage , too . Like most Minnesotans , I grew up in a family that values the outdoors . My grandfather from northern Minnesota was an avid hunter . My dad is a bicyclist , mountain climber , and all - around outdoorsman , and my mom always liked to fish and hike . When I was growing up , we never took a family vacation that didn ’ t involve a tent or a cabin !
Advocating for Minnesota interests in meetings with customs officials and residents of Minnesota ’ s border cities about how to secure our borders . I have worked to cut through the red tape that has been created by some new border crossing laws to help business travelers , tourists , hunters , anglers , and families . As part of this effort , I pushed for the creation of a U . S . passport card as an alternative document for U . S . citizens crossing our northern border to maintain the flow of commerce and tourism , while ensuring security . I also introduced the Cross - Border Trade Enhancement Act to help improve border screening and infrastructure at our borders . This bipartisan legislation was signed into law in 2016 and helps use public - private partnerships to improve trade and security at our norther border . I was also a cosponsor of the Northern Border Security Review Act which was introduced by former Senator Heitkamp and was signed into law in 2016 . The law requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide Congress with regular security assessment reports on the northern border .
The Acting Chairwoman at the FTC has said that the Obama administration ’ s more aggressive approach to competition “ imposed unnecessary costs on business .”
End Illegal Robocalls . Senator Klobuchar will coordinate efforts to crack down on illegal robocalls across the Federal Trade Commission , Federal Communications Commission , and Department of Justice and direct the Department of Justice to aggressively pursue robocall scammers while working with Congress to increase penalties for aggravated violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act .
okay as he pointed out it was during the Civil War so it was like for a really good reason that ' s okay that ' s okay so but Indy did this and I think you know this made national news when Andy did this and he did this in in such a beautiful way and explaining his reasons he just didn ' t go oh I ' m changing I ' m mad he explained it and he did it at a time of deep political division he faced tremendous pressure from fellow Republicans but
So , if you don ’ t think that major mergers – whether it ’ s agriculture , cable , or healthcare companies – impact people , this is all the evidence you need . It does have a big impact on Americans .
Support for Israel . America and Israel are close allies whose interests in the Middle East and around the world remain strongly aligned . The deep and enduring friendship between our nations is based on values rooted in democracy and mutual strategic goals , and we must remain steadfast in our commitment to Israel ’ s security . I have strongly supported funding for security assistance to Israel , particularly for the Iron Dome missile defense system . I have consistently supported additional funds in order to bolster this program , including supporting the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2016 that committed $ 38 billion in military aid to Israel over the next ten years . At the same time , I believe that the United States must reinforce its commitment to leading a meaningful peace process of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians . With dialogue , patience , and resolve , our ultimate goal of peace through the region can be realized . As staunch allies of Israel , we must also ensure that harmful movements , like the resurgence in anti - Semitism and the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions ( BDS ) Movement are not successful . The BDS movement undermines a two - state solution and is counterproductive to both Israelis and Palestinians .
For the last few decades , however , Supreme Court cases — like Trinko , Credit Suisse , Leegin , among others — have raised barriers to the pursuit of antitrust cases . And as Judge Gorsuch is an antitrust expert , it ’ ll be a good thing to pursue with him next week . Because these are important questions , especially in light of the broad economic implications .
Fully fund the IDEA and reinstate the guidance protecting the rights of students with disabilities . Senator Klobuchar ’ s budget will fully fund IDEA to support students with disabilities . In addition , Senator Klobuchar will reinstate documents protecting the rights of students with disabilities after Secretary DeVos rescinded 72 guidance documents outlining those rights .
Providing first responders with life - saving communications tools . I was an original cosponsor of the Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act to allow for state - of - the - art technology that will help first responders in both rural and urban communities at no cost to taxpayers . I helped pass legislation to implement a nationwide wireless network to allow our first responders to clearly communicate when disaster strikes and focus on doing what they do best – saving lives . As co - chair of the Next Generation 9 - 1 - 1 Caucus , I worked with members from both parties to successfully reauthorize the federal 9 - 1 - 1 Coordination Office to manage the transition to the Next Generation 9 - 1 - 1 emergency response system . I have also passed legislation to require multi - line phone systems to have direct dial 9 - 1 - 1 functionality , which would make accessing first responders easier for those in need . This legislation was signed into law in February 2018 .
I ’ m trying to make the case for you today that this is not only important , but it ’ s cool to talk about , because it ’ s all about what ’ s going to happen with the economy .
For farmers in rural America , net income is 50 percent of what it was three years ago . And the poverty rate for kids in rural areas is four percentage points higher than in urban areas .
obstacles as obstacles on our path did we view the snow as an obstacle no we did not let ' s see those obstacles as our path this is what I mean there are insidious forces every day that are trying to make it harder for people to vote trying to drown out our voices with big money it is time to organize time to galvanize time to take back our democracy it ' s time America time to pass a constitutional amendment
Enacting into law the recommendations of the 9 / 11 Commission . When I arrived in the Senate many of the important 9 / 11 Commission recommendations had been languishing for years . In my first six months as a senator , I helped pass the Implementing Recommendations of the 9 / 11 Commission Act to provide our government with a blueprint to prevent future catastrophes and strengthen the resources available to our first responders . These critical reforms provide increased funding to protect our ports , borders , and critical infrastructure , including enhancing rail and aviation security .
Early warning signs suggest that the Trump Administration will appoint people who will scale back enforcement . Peter Thiel , one of the President ’ s close advisers has mocked free markets , saying “ competition is for losers .”
Over the past decades , the men and women of our Armed Forces have been asked to fight two separate , difficult wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . Faced with tremendous challenges , our troops have responded with great skill , courage , and honor . Since these wars began , more than two million U . S . troops have been deployed . Thousands of Minnesotans in uniform have served in Iraq and Afghanistan . Minnesota ’ s active duty servicemen and women , National Guard members , and Reservists have continued our state ' s proud tradition of military service to the nation .
I will say that Senator Mike Lee and I have worked very well on these issues together and painstakingly worked out ideas for conditions and other things when we send letters and work with the Antitrust Division . And they have told us repeatedly how helpful it is for them because , in fact , these are bipartisan suggestions and ideas for others .
Expand Medicaid reimbursement for people receiving mental health or substance use treatment . While she works to pass a permanent legislative solution , Senator Klobuchar will make it easier for states to qualify for waivers that allow for Medicaid reimbursements for people receiving mental health or substance use care in facilities with more than 16 beds .
As a member of the National Guard Caucus , I have been steadfast in my support of the Minnesota National Guard members who continue to serve us bravely and honorably , both at home and abroad . I worked to pass the National Guard Empowerment Act to help upgrade Guard members by creating a position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the National Guard and Reserves as well as improving federal - state military coordination in domestic emergency response scenarios . I have been committed to supporting their families , who bear extraordinary burdens while their loved ones are deployed overseas . During my time in the Senate , I have worked to ensure equitable GI benefits for Guard members and Reservists . I ’ ve supported the largest increase in Army Guard Active Guard Reserve positions in 25 years and helped ensure billions of dollars to support upgrades of National Guard equipment and facilities . And I have fought to secure regular funding to extend and expand to the national level Minnesota ’ s pioneering Beyond the Yellow Ribbon Program , which provides community support to Guard members and their families throughout the deployment cycle .
Renew efforts to prevent another financial crisis . The Office of Financial Research , an independent bureau within the Treasury Department , was created by the Dodd - Frank Act to collect information on financial system risks , perform long - term research , and develop risk measurement and monitoring tools to help prevent future financial crises . Senator Klobuchar will restore the mission and stature of the office .
Protecting competition speaks to the basic principles of economic opportunity and fairness .
And there are new types of activity to consider as well . Large institutional investors own almost 70 percent of the stock market . For example , the largest shareholders of Apple and Microsoft are BlackRock and Vanguard . We see this same pattern in pharmacies , soft drinks producers , and banks . It is easy to see how this cross - ownership could hurt consumers .
you don ' t think we can win in the Midwest I have four words for you former Governor Scott Walker and he didn ' t win everything in Iowa but we flipped to house eats and city that happened and we ' re excited about Rita and we are really excited about JD winning in the state of Iowa so that ' s what happened we flipped those so when you look back at 2016 you realize we need to bring those people with us nearly ten percent of Donald Trump

Prevent people with severe mental illness from acquiring guns . Senator Klobuchar will restore a rule requiring the Social Security Administration to submit records of people with severe mental illness to the FBI ’ s National Instant Criminal Background Check System .
dove into the murky water over and over again looking through those cars and trucks submerged for survivors they saw it in the story of Paul texted the semi - truck driver who sacrificed his own life by veering off the road to save a school bus full of kids they saw it in the school staff member journey Hernandez who rescued each and every kid on that miracle school bus as it hung precariously next to a guardrail after plummeting 30 feet later we worked
Restore staffing levels at the Office of Civil Rights and the Office of Federal Student Aid . The Trump Administration has dramatically cut staffing levels at the Department of Education . Senator Klobuchar will restore staffing levels at the Department of Education , including at the Office of Civil Rights and the Office of Federal Student Aid , which has created obstacles for processing more than 87 , 000 borrower defense claims as well as impeded investigations into Title IX violations .
The United States and our allies should work to help the government in Kiev and deescalate the violence in eastern and southern Ukraine . I supported legislation that was signed into law in March 2014 to help accomplish these goals by authorizing loan guarantees and other assistance to help support the new Ukrainian government and imposing targeted sanctions on Russian officials who have contributed to the crisis .
Bring cyber - security expertise into the Defense Department immediately . Senator Klobuchar will direct the Department of Defense to immediately provide adequate staffing for cyber security programs , as Congress has already provided the Pentagon with special authority to recruit civilian cybersecurity experts .
Combating Iran ’ s destabilizing activity in Syria . The Syrian conflict has led to one of the world ’ s worst ongoing humanitarian crises and the worst refugee crisis since World War II . An estimated 250 , 000 to 500 , 000 people have been killed and more than 5 million Syrians have registered as refugees since the Syrian conflict began in 2011 . This crisis requires an international response and clear U . S . policy to address Iran ’ s destabilizing activity in the region . I opposed the President ’ s sudden announcement of the Administration ’ s plans to quickly withdraw our troops from Syria , which was contrary to the advice of our senior national security officials .
up calling people all over the country cuz no one would call me back and I finally ended up just calling everyone I knew in my life and I raised what is still an all - time Senate record I raised $ 17 , 000 from ex - boyfriends I did that and as my husband has pointed out it is not an expanding base so if we want a real democracy we need to pass aggressive campaign finance reform and get the dark money out of these politics all right and guess what we can do two

I think the American people intuitively understand that there ’ s too much concentration in this country — even if they can ’ t always describe it . In fact , two - thirds of Americans , including a majority of Republicans , have come to believe that the economy “ unfairly favors powerful interests .”
There are signs of anticompetitive concentration everywhere . As former Chair and current ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee , I ’ ve raised concerns about several mega - merger proposals during the last couple years .
their business interests in front of our country they ' re not putting partisan or political interests in front of our country great example right next to me over here so this is what is what that she said about Liz I ' ve seen her skin grow thick through the years yep and I have no clue how she pushes herself to keep going she handles every punch thrown at her with grace and dignity she gives everything she has to this state I am so utterly proud of my mom and her

Thank you , Winnie , for that kind introduction . And thank you to the Center for American Progress for hosting this important event and inviting me talk about the importance of antitrust law .
So , you ’ d think that in light of this consensus , the enormous economic consequences of antitrust enforcement , and the current merger wave — we ’ d already be tackling this issue . Unfortunately , that ’ s not quite true .
Helping veterans transition back to the civilian workforce . Thousands of the brave men and women who serve in our military receive excellent training that is highly valued in the civilian workforce . I helped pass the VOW to Hire Heroes Act into law in November 2011 to promote the hiring of unemployed veterans by requiring separating servicemembers to participate in career training programs and providing a tax credit to employers who bring unemployed veterans into their workforce . I also introduced the bipartisan Post - 9 / 11 Veterans Job Training Act to allow veterans to use their GI Bill benefits for job training and apprenticeship programs to help them obtain the skills they need to succeed in the civilian workforce . This provision went into effect in October 2011 .
Undertake aggressive retrospective review of mergers . To tackle corporate consolidation in what she has called “ the new gilded age ,” Senator Klobuchar will direct her Attorney General to have DOJ ’ s Antitrust Division undertake aggressive retrospective reviews of mergers . She will introduce legislation to increase funding for antitrust enforcement efforts by adjusting merger filing fees and she will change the legal standards to promote competition and prevent consolidation .
Or here in the U . S ., the Nixon administration concluded during Watergate that the best way to intimidate the nation ’ s three major television networks was to keep the constant threat of an antitrust suit hanging over them . And we all know how that ended .
The Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice should gather information about how investment fund ownership affects competition .
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the stage well hello good neighbors it is great to be back here at the wingding last time I had 20 minutes and this time I have 20 candidates ah and I get to go first and
As your senator , I believe a major part of my job includes ensuring that we have the right policies to protect the natural resources we enjoy in Minnesota – our lakes , rivers , and wetlands , our forests and prairies , our wildlife habitats , and abundant farmland . It is our responsibility to pass on this Minnesota way of life to future generations with responsible conservation of our national resources and smart policies that allow our outdoor recreation , fishing , and hunting industries to thrive . That is why I am dedicated to promoting responsible policies that counter climate change , preserve our farmlands , reduce flooding dangers , and keep our air and water clean .
Combating global poverty and disease . We must continue to lead the global fight against AIDS , Zika , Ebola , malaria , and other diseases that are devastating entire regions . We must develop and distribute stockpiles of medicine and vaccinations to prevent future global epidemics .
We need to understand how prevalent the problems are and whether current antitrust tools are sufficient to address them .
For years , there were a few , dominant breweries , and they all sold similar mass - market beer . By 1978 , there were fewer than 50 brewers nationwide .
Support the Manufacturing Extension Partnership . The Manufacturing Extension Partnership program helps small manufacturers innovate , upgrade their technology and improve production . Senator Klobuchar will support and expand this program , which the Trump Administration has tried to eliminate .

Ensuring that our troops have the resources and support they need to do their jobs and remain safe . I have traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan to see firsthand the actions of our brave Minnesotans in the field and to meet with U . S . military commanders and diplomatic leaders . I have been impressed by our military leadership , encouraged by the spirit of our soldiers , and honored to meet with Minnesota troops and thank them for their service and sacrifices on behalf of our nation . I came home with a commitment to give our troops stationed in combat zones the equipment and resources they need to successfully carry out their missions and to ensure they are treated with the respect they deserve when they return home . In the Senate , I have supported funding increases for better and safer equipment – including to provide our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with mine - resistant combat vehicles and individual troop body armor – and to address shortfalls in critical National Guard equipment . I fought for and voted in favor of the 2018 budget deal lifting the budget caps on both the Department of Defense and domestic discretionary programs so that the resources needed by both the military and our domestic law enforcement agencies is available . I also fought to create and secure funding for a national Yellow Ribbon program , based on the Minnesota National Guard ’ s ground - breaking model , to ensure that Guard members and their families have the support they need before , during , and after deployments . [ See Veterans section for additional legislation and actions .
New Energy Policies
Direct the Department of Health and Human Services to consider VHA facilities when designating Health Professional Shortage Areas . Senator Klobuchar has long pressed for HHS to consider adding VHA facilities as Health Professional Shortage areas .

Increasing Newborn Care for Veterans . I introduced the Newborn Care Improvement , bipartisan legislation that would double the number of days veterans receive care for their newborns from seven to 14 . Currently , a veteran must find outside healthcare for her child within seven days of birth or the baby will not have health insurance .
To help respond to the crisis of suicides among veterans , I joined with former Senator John McCain and former Representative Tim Walz as one of the original cosponsors of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act , which passed the Senate and was signed into law in February 2015 . This legislation will help expand access to mental health services for veterans by establishing a loan repayment program to help the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) recruit more psychiatric specialists , enhancing resources for veterans transitioning to civilian life , and improving the VA ’ s ability to address traumatic brain injuries .
Direct the Department of Defense and VA to track servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic chemicals . Currently , servicemembers ’ exposure to toxic chemicals such as mold , caustic fumes , open air burn pits , and airborne chemicals during military operations are not being properly documented and tracked by the Defense Department or VA . Senator Klobuchar would direct these agencies to record any environmental health hazard exposure in a servicemember ’ s records during deployment , and the record would then follow the servicemember through his or her career and into veteran status .

And , as merger deals have grown , so have the complexities of the settlements . We often talk about firms being “ too - big - to - fail .” A question for modern antitrust enforcement is whether some mergers are too big to fix .
Restore consumer protections . Senator Klobuchar will direct the Department of Commerce , Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , Federal Trade Commission , Consumer Product Safety Commission , Federal Communications Commission , Department of Transportation and other consumer protection agencies to re - evaluate any Trump Administration actions that have weakened protections for consumers .

Here ’ s what I propose . A better approach would be to require parties to provide information on a yearly basis after the settlement . Then , agencies could easily review the effectiveness of past settlements , which would inform their future decisions . I believe we can design a requirement that both improves the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement without unduly burdening the companies .
Establish a new senior fraud prevention office . Senator Klobuchar will establish a new senior fraud prevention office to educate consumers , expedite the handling of complaints , and coordinate prevention efforts across the federal government .
Propose landmark legislation that drives our changing economy forward and provides opportunity to all Americans . Our laws and our policies have not kept pace with our changing economy and the digital revolution . That ’ s why Senator Klobuchar will propose landmark legislation to take on monopoly power , empower our workers , and protect consumers ’ privacy and health data privacy . She will also invest in quality child care , raise the minimum wage , provide paid family leave , support small business owners and entrepreneurs , as well as establish portable , worker - owned UP Accounts for retirement savings . She will also allow students to refinance their loans at lower interest rates , provide tuition - free community college and technical certifications , and expand Pell Grant eligibility and award amounts . To pay for these policies and reduce the debt , Senator Klobuchar will repeal the regressive portions of 2017 Republican tax reform , equalize tax rates for capital gains and ordinary income , put the Buffet rule in place , and close the carried interest and big oil loopholes .
talking about here because I think so much of what Donald Trump has done has broken down our trust in our elected officials and that ' s what he wants to do every day and so for me one I want to win for a whole ticket right and flip the legislature in the state of Iowa because that is what I have done every single time when I lead the ticket in Minnesota but also because I think we have to remember what true public servants are about they ' re not putting
It was an exciting time to be representing a hungry young company .
