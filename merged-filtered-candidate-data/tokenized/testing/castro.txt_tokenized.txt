the constitutional issues back then was whether education was a fundamental right in the United States under the Constitution and the Supreme Court said the answer was no that was 1973 I entered school in 1979 I think and in the first grade I had a teacher by the name of Miss pigeon and one day in class as a class ended she called me up to the front of the room while everyone else was leaving and she said oh I
No , I mean , first of all , I think like 50 percent of headlines are bullshit . Headlines in newspapers and magazines . Headline writers , collectively , need to be better in touch with reality . It was caught up in a moment postelection of the president in 2008 .
Oh , you know , it ' s hard to tell . I never had a conversation with the writer after that . What I ' ve noticed with feature writers is they want to create this black - and - white about things . I don ' t spend too much time trying to get into the head of folks who write . In fact , I don ' t read that much of what ' s written about me these days . Yeah , I read some , and I think you have to be able to take in both praise and criticism , and to get better with it , but in this world of Twitter and trolls and everything else , I leave most of that aside .
day and I showed it to her I gave her the work and so they oh thank you oh then while you do to this page so I said great you know I ' m gonna have a whole bunch of extra work for the rest of the year but that was my first opportunity to feel special as a student the teacher was telling me as a student you are special you have the ability to do something that the other students in class may or may not have the ability to do either way for a five six year old
Well , I mean , what I ' ve said is that I believe that the American worker should always come first . I also don ' t think that we should summarily say no to striking trade agreements if they make sense for workers and for American business . And , you know , I had a front - row seat to that in Texas , the possibility of that . I also believe that we ' re going to have compete in a global economy . I mean , somebody that is wearing a shirt , or you ' re driving a car , the chances are that was made , perhaps , in more than one country , if it ' s an automobile or a refrigerator . We have this global economy that already is established , and we ' re competing in . It ' s not realistic to think that we ' re going to withdraw from that wholly . I do think that we ought to only strike trade agreements that are good for American workers and American companies . I disagree with people who say we ' re going to close off trade  ' I don ' t agree with that .
we want to compete and we better we need everybody ' s talent we don ' t have a single person to waste everybody counts in this country here in San Antonio I made pre - k for ese happen as president I ' ll make pre - k for the USA happened universal pre - kindergarten for all children whose parents wanted so that all of our nation ' s students can get a strong start and you know what we ' re not going to stop there we ' ll work to make the first two years of college a
thing that I could think about last night and all morning today was when the world I was going to say in the 18 minutes its allotted and it didn ' t get any easier in the last couple of hours because I went home after we kicked off the mayor ' s Fitness Council and you know played basketball and a whole bunch of stuff and got something to eat and then took a shower and started to get ready and kind of left the house in a rush in about halfway here I realized that I
Just a few years ago , families that had never asked for anything found themselves at risk of losing everything . And the dream my grandmother held , that work would be rewarded , that the middle class would be there , if not for her , then for her children - that dream was being crushed . But then President Obama took office - and he took action . When Detroit was in trouble , President Obama saved the auto industry and saved a million jobs . Seven presidents before him - Republicans and Democrats - tried to expand health care to all Americans .
just be reserved for the wealthy few who can afford high - priced defense lawyers innocent until proven guilty should apply to every single American in this country we must also reform our immigration system so that keeping families together instead of tearing them apart is our policy just a couple of days ago President Trump visit in McAllen Texas just south of here
other students and she wasn ' t gonna put up with that basically she had a lot more confidence and she had enough love for us and enough of a motherly instinct to make sure that we were in a place that valued us more and thought more of us than that for high school my brother and I went to Jefferson High School and Joaquin and I our claim to fame there was that we skipped the tenth grade we didn ' t go to tenth grade everybody says that high
President Obama got it done . He made a historic investment to lift our nation ' s public schools and expanded Pell grants so that more young people can afford college . And because he knows that we don ' t have an ounce of talent to waste , the president took action to lift the shadow of deportation from a generation of young , law - abiding immigrants called DREAMers . Now it ' s time for Congress to enshrine in law their right to pursue their dreams in the only place they ' ve ever called America . Four years ago , America stood on the brink of a depression . Despite incredible odds and united Republican opposition , our president took action , and now we ' ve seen 4 . 5 million new jobs .
police officers as disciplinarians of course those are gonna have discipline but we can do it in a more sensible way and not link that to the criminal justice system and that ' s one way that we can slow down that school to Prison Pipeline and also we need to end qualified immunity because qualified immunity has gone way too far in protecting bad actions by police officers restricting the defense of qualified immunity will help especially
and that means that more families are doubling up sleeping on the couches of relatives or even sleeping on the streets but you know what you hardly ever hear about that in politics that ' s going to change we will invest in housing that ' s affordable to the middle class and to the poor and I know that we can turn things around in the Obama administration we made ending homelessness a priority
No . I figured , based on what Donald Trump said on the campaign trail , based on how he got elected , that it would be bad . I said , I believe in late January of 2017 , that this would be the shadiest , most corrupt administration that we had seen in a very long time , and that ' s proven itself to be true . So I didn ' t have a lot of hope , based on his track record , and the people that he was surrounding himself with . Already at the time , there was a question about his national security adviser , and others . And since then , of course , there have been convictions , and an election that has revealed dishonesty , there have been ethics violations and Cabinet secretaries that have had to resign because of that . So it ' s only gotten worse and worse .
Well , he reached out in the spring of 2017 when he put together a dinner of former Housing secretaries to offer their advice , perspective . Unfortunately , I was not able to make it to that dinner that night . But I expressed to him that if there was ever anything that I could be helpful with , any perspective that he wanted me to give , I was perfectly willing to do it . I have not been called .
Is it inevitable that this campaign is going to be run primarily on the issue of immigration ?
Well , do you think that ' s right ? Do you think it ' ll be hard to actually beat him ?
been Patriots who came together to do the hard work that it took to get us closer to our nation ' s ideals those who fought to abolish slavery suffragists who marched and organized for a woman ' s right to vote a generation that sat in at lunch counters and marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge the activists at Stonewall those who inspired a generation that is marching for our lives today people who challenged us to continue to perfect our
American to be the fairest nation we have to reform and reimagine our justice system all over this nation for far too many people of color any interaction with the police can become fatal if police in Charleston can arrest Dylan roof after he murdered nine people worshiping at Bible study without hurting him then don ' t tell me then Michael Brown and Tamir rice and Aiyana Jones and Eric garner Jason Carroll and Stephane Clark and
in law their right to pursue their dreams in the only place they ' ve ever called home America four years ago America stood on the brink of a depression despite incredible odds and United Republican opposition our president took action and now we ' ve seen 4 . 5 million new jobs he knows better than anyone that there ' s more hard work to do but we ' re making progress and now we need to make a choice it ' s a choice between a country where the middle class
everybody no matter who you are no matter the color of your skin what neighborhood you ' re growing up in how much money your folks have or don ' t have but I believe that we can make strong reforms and the reforms that I ' ve suggested on a national use of for standard ending qualified immunity demilitarizing our police ending racial profiling ending stop and frisk if we made those reforms then I believe that policing in America would look totally
for the people who actually need health care for as long as I knew her my grandmother was diabetic like many folks in this community and she grew older and her condition got worse she needed more and more treatment thank God Medicare was there for her Medicare should be there for everybody in this country it ' s time for Medicare for all universal healthcare for every single
school district at Holscher elementary you all know the Edgewood School District in 1973 Edgewood had been part of a lawsuit because challenging Texas ' s way of financing schools saying that property poor school districts like Edgewood were not able to fund education finance education in the same way as property rich school districts and because of that there was a real achievement gap that case went all the way up to the Supreme Court and one of
I was just rereading the 2010 Times Magazine profile of you . Your first big national profile , I think . The headline was ,  ' The Post - Hispanic Hispanic Politician '  '
Estados Unidos y en otro Asteria ante ustedes oi diciendo la siguiente palabras yo soy el candidato para presidente de los Estados Unidos I ' m running for president because it ' s time for new leadership because it ' s time for new energy and it ' s time for a new commitment to make sure that the opportunities that I ' ve had are available to every American in the years to come we must go forward as one nation
When I got back  ' I was 26 . Because we had very strict term limits back then , you could only serve two two - year terms . That ' s a terrible idea because it doesn ' t allow people to develop expertise . I ' m talking about city council now  '
Then they called it " supply - side ." Now it ' s Ryan - " Romney - Ryan ." Or is it " Ryan - Romney "? Either way , their theory has been tested . It failed . Our economy failed . The middle class paid the price . Your family paid the price . Mitt Romney just doesn ' t get it . But Barack Obama gets it . He understands that when we invest in people we ' re investing in our shared prosperity . And when we neglect that responsibility , we risk our promise as a nation .
my fellow Democrats my fellow Americans my fellow Texans I stand before you tonight as a young American a proud American of a generation born as the Cold War receded shaped by the tragedy of 9 / 11 connected by the digital revolution and determined to reelect the man who will make the 21 st century another American Century President Barack Obama the unlikely journey that brought me
I believe that we need to unwritten and make sure that it benefits working people I believe in raising the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour and and you know I ' m not just talking to talk I ' m also walking the walk we ' re paying even our interns on this campaign a minimum wage of $ 15 an hour because we actually we ' re gonna say that other people should do it then we need to do it too we need a tax code that actually rewards people who work allows for them to be able to save
Uh . Yeah . I think it says something about a lot of people asking the question that they don ' t understand the reality of the Latino community in the United States . First of all , there are a tremendous number of Latinos in the United States that are bilingual , and also those that are English - dominant , and also Spanish - dominant . But , you know , my brother and I speak some Spanish . We ' re just not completely fluent . It ' s not 100 or zero . It ' s also ironic because my grandmother and my mother grew up in a time when they were punished for speaking Spanish , and this country effectively was telling them ,  ' You go learn English . Your Spanish isn ' t good enough here .  ' So it ' s very ironic and makes zero sense that now somehow a Latino would be told ,  ' You ' re not good enough because you don ' t speak Spanish .  '
City council ! Well , for city council four years is too short . You know , you can have term limits , but you need more reasonable terms . But the only silver lining was for young , up - and - coming people that wanted to go into politics , you knew when there was going to be an opening . For me and my district , I was going to graduate in 2000 , and there was going to be an open seat in 2001 . So yes , I was anxious to get back home , and I was probably going into politics . But part of it is also the timing : that ' s when the open seat was there .
one instance in this nation in fact we ' ve seen a lot of instances where an officer put something down on the official record but come to find that that ' s not actually what happened the case of laQuan McDonald who was a teenager when he was shot in the back when he was running down the street in the opposite direction from a police officer and basically the Chicago Police Department and people involved in the investigation did what they could to try
I ' m making it my business and we all need to make it our business to ensure that every young person in the city gets a great education so that we can make San Antonio the most globally competitive city in the 21 st century thank you
still working hard to get my mother her only child a chance in life so that my mother could give my brother and me an even better one as my grandmother got older she begged my mother to give her grandchildren she prayed to God for just one grandbaby before she died you can imagine her excitement when she found out her prayers would be answered twice over she was so excited that the day before Joaquin and I were born she entered him a noodle cook - off and she
Thank you . Today - Today , my beautiful wife Erica and I are the proud parents of a three - year - old little girl , Carina Victoria , named after my grandmother . A couple of Mondays ago - a couple of Mondays ago was her first day of pre - K . And as we dropped her off , we walked out of the classroom , and I found myself whispering to her , as was once whispered to me , " Que dios te bendiga ." " May God bless you ." She ' s still young , and her dreams are far off yet , but I hope she ' ll reach them . As a dad , I ' m going to do my part , and I know she ' ll do hers . But our responsibility as a nation is to come together and do our part , as one community , one United States of America ,
Oh , when I was mayor of San Antonio , I pushed for expanding high - quality , full - day pre - K . We didn ' t have the resources to make it universal , but you could clearly see that that was what I wanted to do . And I have championed greater access to things like higher education . So this is not new . Has the party moved to the left since 2016 ? Yeah , of course it has . And is part of running for office understanding what the people whom you would represent want ? Yeah , it is . But these are fully consistent with what I believe , and what I ' ve been working on for the time I ' ve been in public service .
We all celebrate individual success . But the question is , how do we multiply that success ? The answer is President Barack Obama . Mitt Romney , quite simply , doesn ' t get it A few months ago he visited a university in Ohio and gave students there a little entrepreneurial advice . " Start a business ," he said . But how ? " Borrow money if you have to from your parents ," he told them . Gee , why didn ' t I think of that ? and applause ] Some people are lucky enough to borrow money from their parents , but that shouldn ' t determine whether you can pursue your dreams .
pays more so the millionaires can pay less or a country where everybody pays their fair share so we can reduce the deficit and create the jobs of the future it ' s a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guns Pell grants or a nation that invests more in education and it ' s a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas or a leader who brings jobs
