generation of Americans has seen it as their obligation their responsibility to at least try to live up to the pages in our founding documents and where we failed we got up and we tried again this whole country is founded on the idea that we will have disagreements because we live in a republic and in a republic you have disagreements there is no king or tyrant to tell you what to think that ' s the reason we live in a democratic republic and this place here
thousand tanks across the continent Europe ' s once humming economies stood silent over 60 million people had died including 6 million Jews who were killed in the Holocaust here in the United States we mourn for the loss of over 400 , 000 of our soldiers we had spent in today ' s dollars nearly four trillion dollars to secure that victory in World War two but to secure the peace our leaders understood that even more was required of us
cares because those were real emergencies not fake emergencies they weren ' t emergencies being declared by presidents who had promised in Mexico would do something and then it didn ' t happen and then I had to declare emergency or they certainly were not cases where the president came to the Congress including a congress of their own party and said I want to do something and they said no and they said well we ' re going to declare an emergency
in which we have degraded these institutions in our time we have destroyed the Senate ' s responsibility to advise and consent on judicial nominations and Supreme Court nomination that has been turned into a purely partisan exercise by this generation of American politicians I ' m ashamed of that I ' m ashamed to have been here when we did that and I take my share of the responsibility and what I say to my colleagues is we cannot continue to

mr . president last year was the hottest year on record 16 over the last 17 years have been the warmest years ever recorded climate change science is some of the most thoroughly established and well tested research in history and ninety - seven percent of the published research says climate change is real and caused by humans climate change is an urgent threat to our health our national security and our economy how we address it is what we need to debate not whether
For decades , China has used unfair trade practices to undermine American jobs and innovation . While the United States Trade Representative ' s ( USTR ) Section 301 investigation did not address all the threats unfair Chinese trade practices pose to the U . S ., it did identify several serious concerns faced by American workers and businesses . As you approach the final weeks of negotiations with China , we urge you to insist that the deal make substantial , verifiable , and enforceable progress to address the myriad threats identified in USTR ' s investigation .
Truman Secretary of State George Marshall told the nation that without a return to normal economic health in the world there could be no assured peace in other words that famine and poverty remained unchecked across Europe unanswered fascism and communism would soon follow threatening United States interests and global stability at the same time so after years of sacrifice sacrifice that this generation of Americans

climate change which you said was a very real threat there was a an American politician he said the Pope should stick to religion and that he wasn ' t a scientist in fact the Pope is a chemist he is a scientist I ' m glad he was using his voice on this important issue chip and to be clear as what I was saying earlier about the nominees some nominee seemed to have undergone a confirmation process evolution fun but this seems more an effort to
Imagine if , instead of opposing the Keystone Pipeline , we had included it within a bipartisan deal to secure the Clean Power Plan or other meaningful steps to reduce our carbon emissions .

In Washington , it can be easy to mistake bold words with bold actions . In reality , one rarely leads to the other . Real solutions come from acknowledging different interests , agreeing on hard truths , and building a durable consensus to move forward .

droughts displacement and famine from a warming planet America has a strong interest in avoiding that future anybody who has seen what ' s happened since the Arab Spring understands what resulted from a doubling of the price of wheat in Egypt a wise leader could see that a president Truman would see that like the Marshall Plan Paris agreement recognize that in the modern world there is no over there anymore today over there is here and
natural gas production grew by thirty - five percent in the United States in Colorado and expanded by one hundred and thirty - nine percent Colorado now ranks sixth in the country in natural gas production Canada nation ' s 100 largest natural gas fields are now located in Colorado these industries together create good - paying jobs that can ' t be exported overseas and all of these changes taken together are beginning to address climate change from
the wall the wall the president says has already been mostly built that he ' s now declaring a national emergency to build the world is racing ahead of us as I ' ve said on this floor over and over again what we ' re getting run around by one in named distraction after another it ' s been said that the president is somebody who was mostly concerned with winning the politics of any given day that ' s what he tries to do and he ' s often very effective at it we spend a lot of time
long before we began seriously expanding renewable energy and natural gas has been gaining market share compared to Coulson ' s before nineteen ninety Colorado for example is benefited greatly from this natural gas boom in almost every part of the United States natural gas plants are now cheaper to build than coal plant facilities that were built when I became a senator eight years ago were built to import natural gas are now being retrofitted to export
The threat of climate change is grave and growing . The overwhelming scientific consensus calls on us to act . Though most Republicans have cynically withdrawn from this debate , Democrats still have to win it . To break the impasse , we have to learn from our mistakes . That means reaching the small towns , farmers , ranchers and workers who see the dangers of climate change , but who have tuned out . It means choosing arguments that broaden our coalition instead of shrink it .

it is real and as I have said before I will work with anyone in this chamber Republican or Democrat to address this issue and that ' s appropriate because survey after survey of people in Colorado a state that the third democratic third Republican and a third independent demonstrates that they believe the science no matter which party they belong to and in a very welcome sign just last week a group of statesmen including former Secretary of

here is over there that our president does fundamentally doesn ' t understand it he claimed that withdrawing from the Paris agreement would quote put America first in fact this move threatens to put America last last and innovation last in clean energy last in science last in our moral responsibility to hand the next generation is safe and stable planet that is why states and cities all across the country are making their own

if he thinks it is he should sanction himself for failing to keep his promise as I said earlier and this should bother everybody who believes in our system of checks and balances who believes in the Constitution never has a president sought to enact a national emergency like this after Congress has said no Congress has the power of the purse in our Constitution every single senator should be voting to protect that and I ' ve been shocked over

If we ignore these economic realities in our climate debate , we will struggle to break the gridlock in Washington .
the institutions the way they did and that ' s why they created the checks and balances that they did there is a reason no president has ever done what this president is trying to do because they exercise self - restraint because of what ' s in the Constitution and because nobody on this floor would have supported them there are many ways this generation of past politicians and I and I accept my share of the blame there are many ways

For too long , China has used the predatory practices described in USTR ' s Section 301 Report to undermine American jobs and innovation . Ending those practices is therefore a critical step towards reversing the damage such policies have had on the U . S . economy and restoring balance to the U . S .- China trade relationship . We hope that you will use these final weeks of negotiations to achieve a deal that makes substantial , verifiable , and enforceable progress to address these concerns .
Texas I can ' t imagine that it does I don ' t know how anybody could support that and by the way that ' s not even the most important point the most important point is that we have ground ourselves up for a 35 day government shutdown for three months of media cycles on this fight by the president on a wall that he now says is almost fully built while he ' s declaring an emergency to build a wall that hasn ' t been built while we ' re

Furthermore , a satisfactory agreement must include a clear and transparent monitoring and enforcement mechanism that allows the United States to hold China accountable .

To move forward , we need a more inclusive and thoughtful conversation . We should recognize that many communities now rely on energy production for their economic lifeblood . It is not enough to call for less coal or oil without having meaningful work to replace lost jobs . For someone who earned $ 80 , 000 in the energy sector , working in fast food or attending a failed job training program offers little solace . Pretending otherwise leads many Americans to conclude that Democrats don ' t understand their challenges , or even worse , that we don ' t care .
