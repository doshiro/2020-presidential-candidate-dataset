Finally , we should take U . S . military intervention off the table . National Security Adviser John Bolton would have us believe that the choice in Venezuela is between indifference and invasion . That is a false choice , and I reject it .

Israel is a critical ally and friend and its security is a top priority . I absolutely support a two - state solution because it is the best way to ensure the existence of a Jewish , democratic , and secure Israel . Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state , in peace and dignity , just as Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people .
As president , I will focus on advancing relationships in Africa that President Trump has let languish - and I will do so in a way that is consistent with American values . We need to stand up for democracy , human rights , and economic freedom and development . I will reinvigorate American diplomacy throughout the continent , support economic growth , and deepen security engagements with African partners .

Ultimately , we can ' t accept North Korea as a nuclear weapons state . But it ' s clear that simply demanding complete denuclearization is a recipe for failure ; we must work closely with our allies to contain and reverse the short - term threats posed by Pyongyang as we work toward that long - term goal .
equal work I ' m going to shift the burden to the corporations to prove they ' re paying people equally and if not they ' ll be fine as a way to encourage better behaviors but all of these issues are connected and I appreciate you raising the subject we have got to support working parents and again you know on the debate stage you guys probably see you know all of this question all the time how are you gonna pay for how you ' re gonna pay for

As president , I would continue to support Ukraine and ensure the U . S . is unequivocal in affirming Ukraine ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity . I would also prioritize working with the government of Ukraine to build out its military , strengthen its civil society , and combat corruption , while working closely with our European partners on a diplomatic solution . And unlike the current occupant of the White House , I will consistently stand up to Putin in defense of democratic values , human rights , and the international rule of law .

Arizona for the last election and didn ' t have the opportunity to vote in the primary just because of the way things happen and I didn ' t feel like I had a voice so I can go to all these events and be inspired and have hope but I am terrified of what happened last time and that it might happen again how what can we do to ensure that can ' t happen and what are you but what ' s happening because I feel like you can turn out but still it ' s we turned out last time and
there are two groups of people who are raising our children parents could be grandparents aunties and uncles and teachers and we are not paying them their value and we have got to get correct on that on average teachers in America are making 10 % and over less than other college graduates of their stature so what I am proposing is what will be the first time in our nation ' s history a federal investment in closing the

Americans so let ' s answer that question to the world and each other right here and right now America we are better than this we are better than this when we have leaders well bully an attack of Free Press and undermine our Jamaat and democratic institutions that ' s not our America when white supremacists march and murder in Charlottesville or Massacre innocent

Here ' s the truth : climate change is real , and it is an existential threat to our country , our planet , and our future . With each passing day , the imminent threat of climate change grows - and we see it in everything from more instances of extreme weather to rapidly melting glaciers .
Our biggest mistake has been to jeopardize all that progress and accomplishment by engaging in failed wars that have cost lives , destabilized the regions in which they have been fought , and undermined our leadership in the international community . To make matters worse , the current president seems intent on inflicting further damage to U . S . credibility by disregarding diplomacy , withdrawing from international agreements and institutions , shunning our allies , siding with dictatorships over democracies , and elevating sheer incompetence in his decision - making processes .
dreamers he would protect up working people but what did we get instead we got a President of the United States who made a whole lot of promises and betrayed the American people what did we get a lot of broken promises so we need to prosecute the case and I want to tell you there ' s a rap sheet full of evidence to make the case let ' s look at what happened he promised health care and then he tried to rip health care away from
perspective of understanding health care and access to health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it what are the issues that keep people up at night well for so many parents are those who parent children and that ' s grandparents that ' s aunties and uncles we all know the only two groups of people raising our children of parents with grandparents and aunts and uncles and our teachers but we are not paying them their value

and we will honor our servicemembers and veterans so no one who has served this country has to wait in line for weeks and months to get what they are old when they return home on first day I ' m running to fight for an America where no mother or father has to teach their young son that people may stop him arrest him chase him or kill him because of his race
are sending their you know I have kids who are in their 20 s so I ' m going to say children they ' re adults yes but that this is a solemn it promised that we should always make to those families that we will never play politics with the lives of their children and I feel very strongly about that and then we could go on about it down but thank you thank you alright I think that will wrap it up thank you again

Yes . President Trump ' s unilateral withdrawal from an agreement that was verifiably preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon - against the warnings of our closest allies , and without any plan for what comes next - was beyond reckless . Since then , we ' ve seen nothing but escalations from both sides . Either the Trump Administration is angling for another disastrous war in the Middle East , or it has spent two years saber - rattling with no endgame .

one of the best ways to fight for who we are and who we can be as a nation is to organize is to lift up voices is to give working people a chance to be for them what they deserve in all that they deserve in terms of their dignity and as we move toward the future that we all can see and as we fight for that future let ' s remember this is a fight that is born out of optimism this is a fight that is born out of love of country and knowing what
who has been making this a partisan issue it is not a nor should it ever be a partisan issue the relationship that we have with Israel is a relationship between the people of America and the people of Israel and we have to maintain that understanding that we have shared values and common interest and their security should be one of our highest priorities the Palestinians must also be given a voice and their ability to leave their own people and we must understand

The African continent is dynamic , diverse , and full of potential , with the youngest , fastest growing population in the world . There are so many important interests at stake in Africa , from bolstering global security to fostering shared prosperity . The United States must engage now and build strong diplomatic and economic partnerships with these nations or illiberal countries like China and Russia will fill the gaps .

First , I would rejoin the Paris Agreement , so that the world understands America is serious about meeting the most complex , far - reaching challenge of our time - climate change . If we ' re going to be successful , then countries , states , and cities need to transition away from the dirtiest sources of fuel on the planet . Governments around the world should be bringing dangerous coal - fired power plants offline , not bringing new plants online , and underscoring that necessity should be front and center in every one of our bilateral relationships . In addition to applying diplomatic pressure , the U . S . can better assist partners around the world in making the necessary energy transition by providing technical guidance , policy support , and access to capital .
doubters will say it ' s the same thing they ' ve always said they ' ll say it ' s not your time they ' ll say wait your turn they ' ll say the odds are long they ' ll say it can ' t be done but but America ' s story has always been written by people who can see what can be unburdened by what has been that is our story that is our story and as Robert Kennedy many years ago said only those who dare to fail greatly can

progressive and making sure that we are trying to deal with and end the mass incarceration problem that America has people said it can ' t be done and I didn ' t listen and I but here ' s the important part and I know we got a lot of media people here here ' s the important part not only did I not listen the people didn ' t listen the people do and I became the first woman in that office and the first woman of color in the history of the state of California
concerning herself with the security of our nation and homeland but what are we got in this Donald Trump a so - called commander - in - chief who on the subject of Russia ' s interference in the election of the President of the United States prefers to take the word of the Russian president over the word of the American intelligence community what have we seen in terms of betrayal of our national security on the subject of an American student who was tortured and later died
we speak we ' ll make everybody happy they will make everyone feel lovely they will sprinkle lovely dust all over the room and everybody will applaud and job will have been done well speaking truth doesn ' t always accomplish that goal but the other thing about speaking truth is this yes people may walk away from that conversation thinking you know I didn ' t particularly like what I had to hear but they will also walk away from that conversation knowing it was an honest
China ' s abysmal human rights record must feature prominently in our policy toward the country . We can ' t ignore China ' s mass detention of more than a million Uighur Muslims in " reeducation camps " in the Xinjiang region , or its widespread abuse of surveillance for political and religious repression . We can ' t ignore Beijing ' s failure to respect the rights and autonomy of Hong Kong ' s people and the Hong Kong government ' s excessive use of force against peaceful protestors . President Trump has consistently turned a blind eye to these abuses in hopes of earning a ' win ' in his trade war , all to no avail .
when I think about our march toward 2020 that is the lens through which I think about it and I ' ll tell you as a Democrat I also say this I reject the notion that some Democrats are trying to push let ' s say when you ' re in the Midwest you have one conversation when you ' re down south that ' s a different conversation we ' re on the coast that ' s a different conversation because I know when the vast majority of us wake up in the middle of
First of all , we need to end U . S . support for the catastrophic Saudi - led war in Yemen , which has driven the world ' s worst humanitarian crisis . I voted to do just that earlier this year . I also voted to block the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia that only help continue this atrocity . Unfortunately , President Trump vetoed both of those measures . He has stood in lockstep with Riyadh , even turning a blind eye to the heinous assassination of U . S .- based journalist Jamal Khashoggi .
its institutions and leaders and the thing about a relationship of trust which we all know is that by its very nature a relationship of trust is reciprocal be given your received trust and one of the most important ingredients in trust is truth but there ' s a funny thing about truth speaking truth can often make people quite uncomfortable and for those of us who speak behind a microphone and behind a podium there is an incentive that when
thank you so let me just I just want to talk a little bit about what I ' m seeing around our country and from the perspective of being where he sent me to Washington DC about two years and some months ago the importance of restoring truth and justice in our country couldn ' t be more real you know there are a lot of people we all know this in our country who are rightly feeling a great deal of distrust in their government and
issue that is really pretty basic assault weapons assault weapons were designed to kill a lot of people quickly there is no reason they should be available on the streets of a civil society why do we need background checks well it ' s really pretty basic and by the way I reject a false choice you either in favor the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone ' s guns away I ' m in favor of the Second Amendment but I know we need background checks I ' m going to
and then it ' s going to be about re - engaging with our allies around the globe there is no question that we have a responsibility to lead on this with our allies but we have done so much you know in the good years we had a clean power plan we you know I if you ' ll pardon my you know referring to my state of California but I ' ve actually seen firsthand what we do as Attorney General I defended some of the strongest laws around greenhouse gas emissions against
It ' s wrong for America to abdicate our responsibility to address this planetary crisis . Surely , in 2017 , we can all agree that the ability to breathe clean air and live in a safe and healthy environment should be a priority ?
happening in terms of local universities around that the the innovation that is going to actually contribute to our goal of having a clean economy so I think about it in that regard as well but yeah the point that you ' re raising is just another example of the hypocrisy of the Trump administration he says he cares about farmers he says he cares about the little guy and every step of the way it ' s been about supporting corporations and big business
the America I believe in that ' s the America I know we believe in and as we embark on this campaign I will tell you this I am not perfect lord knows I am not perfect but I will always speak with decency and moral clarity and treat all people with dignity and respect I will lead with integrity and I will speak the truth and of course we know this is not going to be easy guys it ' s not gonna be easy and we know what the

dude got to go do gotta go so we are gonna fight knowing that we have so much more in common than what separates us and the way I think about it is what I call the three in the morning thought you know when you wake up in the middle of the night with that thought that ' s been weighing on you well for the vast majority of us when we wake up thinking that thought it is never through the lens of the party with which we ' re registered to vote for the vast majority
this is a combination this proposal of a lot of folks input and many of whom are in this room what I am proposing is that for families who make less than $ 100 , 000 a year as a family they will receive a $ 6 , 000 tax credit that they can receive it up to $ 500 a month economists economists are describing it as what would be the most significant middle - class tax cut we have seen in this country in generations we have got to speak truth let ' s speak truth we are
it ' s a system bigger than us that I feel I lose hope I ' m terrified that ' s what I ' m scared of so just always remember the power is in the people you have to remember that and you have to know that you have to know that and so here ' s the thing first of all you know I just disagree with the pundits when they when they rely too much on 2016 as a predictor of 2020 2020 will not be 2016 guys and for a number of reasons one people are woke
While all Americans have an interest in a peaceful resolution to the Arab - Israeli conflict , the fact remains that peace can only be achieved if the parties themselves come to an agreement . The U . S . can - and should - serve as a constructive partner in the process . Unfortunately , while , in the past , the U . S . has been viewed as an honest broker with a strong desire for peace in the region , Trump ' s actions have inflamed tensions in the region , diminished U . S . credibility and influence , and undermined the prospects for peace . As President , I would start by reaffirming the U . S . commitment to Israel ' s security and prosperity , while simultaneously working to rebuild the broken relationship between the United States and the Palestinians . Among all of our international partners , the U . S . is uniquely positioned to facilitate negotiations toward peace , but for that to have any chance of success , we have to start by re - engaging in honest , respectful dialog with both sides .
who have never been involved before including you know Republican men who have been dragged into my events by their daughters so we have to you know hear Coretta Scott King I ' m gonna paraphrase but she had some advice that I often think about and I ' ll paraphrase but she said you know the fight for civil rights and you can think about as the fight for justice they fight for equality the fight for freedom the fight for civil rights must be fought and one

leadership that has prepared based on a demonstration of ability to take them on and to do the right thing on this issue I have that history I have taken them on and I will do that as president so there are many other issues to discuss but you know I just I ' m gonna close my comments so I can start hearing for me but just also discussing at this phase of the campaign what I think is an elephant or maybe even a donkey in the
common ground here ' s what I say I think we need to recognize we are already standing on common ground I say we rise together or we fall together as one nation indivisible and I want to be perfectly clear I ' m not talking about unity for the sake of unity so hear me out I ' m not talking about unity for the sake of unity I ' m not talking about some facade of unity and I believe we must acknowledge that the word unity has often been used to
country it ' s a moment in time that is requiring us each and collectively you look in a mirror and ask a question that question being who are we and I think we all know part of the answer to that question is we are better than this so this is a moment in time for us to fight for the best of who we are and fight we will and this is not a new fight for us we fight for our country that ' s the nature of who we are and so we ' re going to fight because we love our country and
In both Ukraine and Georgia , Russia has used military force to seize territory and undermine democratically elected governments . Russia ' s illegal occupation of Crimea is a severe violation of the international norms that have guided the world since World War II - as are Russia ' s support for combat operations in eastern Ukraine and its cyber - attacks . Thousands of people have died because of Russia ' s aggression , including 298 civilians killed when a Russian missile shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014 .
