black activist who ' s the head of the Fair Housing Council and a group of white volunteers and who had watched and been inspired by the courage of civil rights marchers they worked to help black families in their community come together and they stood up against the illegal housing discrimination that my parents faced and they won and they changed the course of my entire life and so when you grow up with a mom like mine they made sure that
exists in our country I believe in it I ' m putting my faith in that message that heart and that reality in America it ' s a lot of people in New Jersey are gonna sit and look at this and say you know we have another guy who ran for president four years ago and we spent a lot of time not doing his job how do you convince people that you can run a campaign and yet not make the same mistakes that Chris Christie made look at the voters of New Jersey put their
your fellow country man and woman all of them and when you seek to lead in your community in your church in your city and your country in your nation you got to know you can ' t leave the people if you don ' t love the people all the people we now must have the courage to turn to each other to join together we must reaffirm our common bonds in the face of those who every day seek to rip us asunder
first things I did on the day I was sworn in by Joe Biden as a as United States Senator was he invited me to the Oval Office and we sat and had a heart - to - heart and he gave me some of the best advice I could get as to become a senator in fact that day the best advice I got in my early days rather was from John McCain and from President Barack Obama about what it meant to be a state ' s person to put patriotism but before petty personal attacks so we ' ve
and report these crimes that threaten our security and safety with chilling regularity we must change our laws but I can repeat we must also confront our past the truth is there is another story we can tell about our country a better story not one that ignores our mistakes or accommodates our past failures and not one that just glorifies our history or or that puts forth this so - called great man history of our country we can tell a story about who we have been
broken but we still found ways to bring people together and get things done after decades of criminal justice system moving in the wrong direction I led a bipartisan effort to write and pass the first meaningful reform in a generation and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to write and then pass a law that is bringing billions of dollars of investment to low - income urban and rural communities that have for too long been left out and left behind there are so
generation has had it but remember how we made that radical change some people say to me Cory you know you ' re not gonna beat Donald Trump with love and I tell them right away I ' m the guy that has a movie about him called street fight oscar - nominated I ' m the guy that took on a political machine you can fight with a ferocity but without being cruel you can fight with strength without being me you can lift folks up without tearing others down
you love your fellow countrymen and women doesn ' t mean we ' re always gonna agree or somedays always like each other but we gotta extend each other grace less judgment and more hard work to find common ground to do the things that other people on the planet earth don ' t think we can do we ' re a nation that leads and we ' ve got to get back to doing that together so I ' m happy to answer any questions you all want but I ' m grateful seriously grateful to have you all in
to them they sound like gunshots we will pass universal background checks we will ban assault weapons and close the loopholes that allow people who should never have a gun to get one and folks we will bring a fight to the NRA like they have never ever seen before and we will win we won ' t wait to meet the challenge and the crisis of climate change because we have no other choice we will build a clean energy economy we will hold polluters accountable and
of unjust policies that have destroyed our economy and extracted money from our Commonwealth and plowed it into tax cuts for the wealthy and Wars overseas we didn ' t have to fight instead of investing in the things we all know grow our economy and create more opportunity for all like at education and infrastructure and that ' s why when I am President of
the word wait this wait has almost always meant never we come to see that justice too long delayed is justice denied Martin Luther King on this date in history he spoke to the possibility of what we can achieve when we realize our own power and when we refused to wait the children of Birmingham and a man named King joining arms with others showed what was possible when they refused to wait and confronted dogs and fire hoses when they confronted and
sacrifice and struggle but that ' s the nature of love we are here today because of our ancestors showing this kind of sacrifice this kind of love because of those who join together across lines of separation to join in pursuit of our common national aspiration they did what was difficult because they had faith in God in each other and in a bolder broader more inclusive patriotism for patriotism is love of country but you can ' t love your country unless you love
common than divides us I believe that this reflexive partisanship is undermining our ability to find common ground and get common - sense things done we right now agree on enough to make big changes in America to drive down health care costs to drive up student achievement to fix our infrastructure to provide better education to make us safer and stronger and more prosperity for a more prosperous and so I ' m really excited over the coming months to put my
period in American history has to be about more than just one office and one person it has to be that moral moment in our nation like the civil rights movement where you expand the consciousness of our country and return the power in this nation to the people and power concedes nothing without a demand we must organize we must fight and even after election day in 2020 whoever is president and whoever the Democratic nominee all of us must line
hello everybody I am so grateful to be here and I want to start with a counterintuitive statement there is this mistake people make about presidential elections and we ' ve heard it from somebody who I won ' t mention who says only I can solve all the problems we have to remember how change is made it wasn ' t a whole bunch of fellas and the early 1900 ' s who gathered together on the Senate floor and said it ' s about
well I called on crews first because when I was mayor he gave me my most difficult questions I started start with hardest first look you know love and easy and our history in this country there ' s some of the toughest most heroic people that I admire whose pictures hang in my office who statues are in the Capitol there folks that took on armed hate billy clubs and dogs and fire hose with unarmed love and they took down jim crow their folks like a great New Jersey
I am deeply disturbed by the human rights abuses happening in China ' s Xinjiang region and support putting companies that build the detention camps there and their surveillance systems on the Commerce Department ' s Entity List , in addition to using the Global Magnitsky Act to sanction the people involved with the detention camps .
The infrastructure of the 21 st century must move toward renewable and clean energy . There are a number of levers we should use to discourage the proliferation of coal - fired power plants around the world , including starving financing for coal - fired projects through our voting power in international financing institutions ; pressuring our friends and allies to halt the exporting of coal - fired plants ; increasing funding for renewable energy projects and clean development ; and encouraging smart grid build - outs and better energy standards across the developing world to reduce demand for coal - fired power plants . If I am president , the United States will lead , not only by example and in a way that ensures a just transition for workers in impacted communities , but through affirmative steps to encourage action across the globe .
It was a serious mistake for President Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal , and I never would have done it . The JCPOA brought transparency into Iran ' s nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout by at least 10 years . Without an agreement , Iran is now able to rapidly enrich uranium and drastically reduce the time it would take for them to produce a nuclear weapon .
lifetime we did things that other people thought were impossible to do we assured in New York ' s biggest economic development period in 60 years building our new first new office towers and our first new hotel is putting new workers to work constructing them in New Yorkers to work in those buildings we brought supermarkets to food deserts we improved our public schools to a level now in fact if you are black kid in Newark which is our majority of our

In early 2016 , Senator Booker travelled with his Senate colleagues to the Middle East and Europe to discuss strategies for continuing to counter Iran ' s destabilizing activities and ensure that Iran is meeting its commitments as a part of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action .
you ' re probably not doing that much well again this is what we have is people for political purposes trying to not talk about what they ' re for but talk about what they ' re against new workers and I think people in cities all across America are tired of people that are putting that putting down our urban spaces making trying to make them into jokes ridicule and demeaning them integrating them my time here in New York during the worst economy of my

I support imposing sanctions on Maduro and his top officials for corruption and human rights violations committed against their own people . We should also engage closely with our partners in the region to pursue a diplomatic , negotiated settlement , including by working with a transitional government in Venezuela that can lead to peaceful elections and a return to democratic norms and stability .
in church growing up the kind of courageous love of people who could love those who hated them who despised and cursed them a heroic love that pushed people to March knowing they could be beaten to board buses knowing that they could be bombed to join with others to sit in knowing that they could be dragged to the ground kicked and spit and sent to jails and hospitals a love fueled by multiracial multi - ethnic coalition ' s that share a commitment to
the filibuster is a decision that ' s made in the Senate my colleagues and I everybody I ' ve talked to believe that the legislative filibuster should stay there and I will personally resist efforts to get rid of them you know anybody who knows my history knows that my history is standing up for people that are awful often being hurt by bad actors I lived in Newark during the mortgage crisis I saw the predatory loans where
conduct assessments of the domestic terrorist threats that are posed by white supremacists to take this more seriously to act on the threat and to publicly and transparently report annually to Congress and the public on these threats we must require the FBI to dramatically change and improve reporting of hate crimes and work with local law enforcement to establish policies to to focus on training to focus on how to identify and investigate
At the same time , past leaders have also made mistakes . The consequences of the war in Iraq have been staggering -- taking thousands of lives and costing trillions of dollars , all while making our country and the region less secure . And we cannot assess the full impact of the ill - fated decision without also considering the opportunity cost : the Iraq War has undoubtedly undermined our ability to effectively address many of the massive challenges of the 21 st century -- from climate change to technological advancement to inequality .
serious challenges as a nation were with us long before Donald Trump entered the White House we can ' t wait because we have a criminal justice system that in the words of my friend Brian Stevenson treats you better if you ' re rich and guilty than if you ' re poor and innocent a system a system so deeply baked with bias that it ruthlessly discriminates against black people and brown people and low - income people with mental illnesses folks with addiction we can ' t

We must be a nation that leads with our values . We need a reset in our relationship with Saudi Arabia , starting with an end to U . S . arms sales and transfer of nuclear technology . I have voted to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia over human rights abuses and killings of innocent civilians in Yemen . We must also continue to push for accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi through a legitimate investigation and sanctions on those responsible for his death .
have enough counselors mental health professionals our schools need more supportive environments our schools should be more than just schools but cathedrals of learning where we support our children I believe in public education I am a product of public education and as a senator I I ' ve invested my time and effort working with teachers groups around this country I ' m Cory Booker and I ran for Senate and got the endorsement of our state ' s teachers
what got me into politics when I when I started out that the central Ward of Newark was having a lead crisis because of lead paint at that time but even we stand here right now we have Superfund sites that are that are within us just a few miles of where we stand and we now know from Princeton data that children being born around Superfund sites he ' s the highly toxic sites in our country have 20 % or significantly higher rates of autism significantly higher rates of
Stabilizing the territory taken from the Islamic State is undoubtedly essential to ensuring terrorist threats do not re - emerge , and that must be a priority for the United States . But as the threat from the Islamic State diminishes and the Syrian conflict returns to a battle over whether Mr . Assad will regain full control over land held by rebels who are divided among themselves , it is no longer possible to argue that the mission is one of self - defense . If the president were to order American troops to hold Syrian territory in those circumstances , he would be ordering them to act in clear violation of the United Nations Charter .
seeing their rights eroded we will build and an opportunity economy where there are good paying jobs and fair wages in every neighborhood and where the dignity of work is respected where benefits are secured and portable so you can change jobs or start a new business with confidence and where small businesses can be as they always have been the main engines of job growth and economic growth in America and and we will change we will close we
Senator Booker is a proponent of partnering with our critical strategic allies , and has proudly called for expanding American support for cooperative defense programs with Israel . Senator Booker will continue to be a staunch advocate for a strengthened relationship with Israel . In one of the Senator ' s first official trips abroad , Senator Booker travelled to Israel where he met with senior Israeli officials , members of Parliament and Israeli security forces to discuss America and Israel ' s shared democratic , economic and security objectives .
In winter of 2015 , Senator Booker travelled to the Paris Climate Conference to represent the United States in bilateral talks concerning the effects of climate change on the international community and international security .
I support a two - state solution because I believe in justice and self - determination for both Israelis and Palestineans . As President of the United States , I will be committed to finding a two - state solution to the conflict so that both Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side in peace with dignity and security .
Senator Booker has made countering the threats posed by terrorist groups a priority , and believes it is important for Congress to debate and vote on an Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) against ISIS .
a nation with the favours unions and gives them the power they need to organize and to grow and not shrink and decrease we need presidents that are going to organize for our rural brothers and sisters living in communities that are being hollowed out and disinvested this has got to be a different kind of election because there ' s too many of our brothers and sisters that are hurting I live in an amazing city in an amazing unity I ' m proud to be the only one in
thought were impossible my parents generation knew that if we came together blacks and whites Christians and Jews we can up and Jim Crow we used to be a people that can point into the sky and look at the moon and change it from a dream to a to a destiny there ' s no Republican or democratic way to get there you definitely don ' t get there if I fightin each other beating each other down and dividing people against themselves we did those things because
faith in me and I will never ever let them down I ' m gonna continue to be an active force in the Senate and at a time of cynicism in Washington heck if you just look at the last Congress at a time that people don ' t believe Washington can get big things done in the last Congress alone I was able to work across the aisle with my partners and get big pieces of legislation done you know the system of mass incarceration in this nation is a shame to a nation that is
ideas before the American people and I know that I have confidence in them but the other thing I ' m going to be trying to do over these next month ' s is to just appeal to what I know is the goodness and the decency of Americans and we ' ve got to stop that trash - talking twitter trolling tearing folks down this is a time for all of us to think about our role in putting the indivisible back in in this one nation under God what ' s that I definitely can and I ' m gonna let this
I am also a co - sponsor of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act , which requires a series of reports on China ' s treatment of the Uighars , including from the State Department and the Director of National Intelligence , that would be used to determine whether certain individuals meet the criteria for sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act .
our contradictions and to be willing to question what we sometimes hold sacred this is a lesson I have learned over and over again in my own life with my own for lt '' s and to love our country in this moment means that we have to step outside of our comfort zones and confront that which is in ourselves this is a moment that calls for us to ask hard questions and genuinely then seek the answers we need to be honest about not just who we are but who we have been
warning of an invasion it was sold by those who spoke of an infestation of disgusting cities rats and rodents talking about majority minority communities it was sold by those who ' ve drawn an equivalence between neo - nazis and those who protest them it was sold from the highest office in our land we see in tweets and rhetoric hateful words that ultimately endanger the lives of people in our country people of color immigrants of us all but let ' s be clear
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations , Senator Booker plays a critical role in the Senate ' s efforts to keep America safe and secure .
inspire us to common cause to get us off the sidelines to remember the democracy ' s a verb I ' m running because I know whether you ' re suburban or rural black or Latino that I could be the next leader to ignite this country to remember not just that we need to fight but why we fight and so I ask everybody right now to remember why we fight we fight for our children we fight for those who may not pray like us or look like us but they are just as American as
cross the street people said I was a really nice guy now when I help somebody across the street there ' s somebody standing back and saying oh he ' s just trying to get a vote there ' s a lot of understandable cynicism out there and I feel like the best way to do that is with your actions I believe we are a great nation because we have stuck up for each other and we ' ve got to stop bad actors from taking advantage of people it happens I see it in in the changes
I voted against fast - track authority and opposed the TPP because it put large corporations before workers , and would have led to the further decline of U . S . manufacturing . I will only support a trade deal that , at its core , is focused on advancing the American worker and working families -- creating jobs , lifting wages , and boosting environmental standards .
equality for all people who invested themselves in the idea and understanding that we need each other this is the story of our nation that we must tell not the absence of racism and bigotry and anti - semitism but the power of what happens when we come together across the lines that divide us to affirm the ties that bind us and work to create a more Beloved Community in our nation this is the story of this sanctuary this Church of faith and fellowship of the Bible
women who organized for the right to vote multi racial coalition ' s and the men who stood worked and allied with them ours is the story of workers immigrants and native born who joined together to organize an end child labor and create the 40 - hour workweek ours is the story of civil rights activist a rainbow coalition of Americans from every race and every religion joining together who marched and sat in and stood up against segregation and
Our goal has to be the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula . A nuclear North Korea is among our greatest national security threats and we must use every tool available to pursue peaceful denuclearization . I would work closely with our allies to develop and execute a thoughtful strategy to denuclearize the peninsula and address international concerns with the DPRK ' s missile program and proliferation activities .
Senator Booker is honored to serve a state with one of the largest Indian - American diasporas in the country . Senator Booker will continue to work foster investment opportunities , create collaborations between our world - renowned higher education institutions , and cultivate the growing relationship between the U . S . and India , and New Jersey and India .
As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee I signed a letter affirming Ukraine ' s sovereignty , and voted to disapprove of President Trump ' s decision to end sanctions on companies connected to Russian oligarchs . I support increasing the use of the Global Magnitsky sanctions and other tools to assert pressure on Russia into cooperation with the global community . We also need to mend our relationship with our transatlantic allies and NATO , which President Trump ' s has undermined . I would seek to repair any doubts about the U . S . commitment to its allies and partners in NATO .
like courage like our ancestors we will rise thank you Nevada thank you for your love thank you for your decency and your kindness thank you please welcome to the stage mayor Pete Buda judge
this addressing this is not an act of charity or philanthropy it is an issue of national security it is an issue of patriotism is issue of love and we can ' t begin to express that love unless we have a real conversation that we need to be first change in a loss dr . King once said that I quote it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me but it can keep him from lynching me it may be true that the law cannot
The Trump administration might argue that the troops are already in Syria , so keeping them there isn ' t  ' introducing them .  ' But that would make a mockery of the statute . The Obama administration explained in 2015 that the authorizations for the use of military force that Congress agreed to in 2001 and 2002 provided the legal basis for operations against the Islamic State because they were broadly aimed at terrorism as a threat . That justification was tenuous , but surely nothing in the statutes could plausibly be said to extend to an American military presence in Syria after the Islamic State has been credibly debilitated .
wait when we have an economy where people who work two or three jobs pick up extra shifts where they can and they still can ' t pay the bills profits are soaring while wages for most Americans have barely budged massive corporations have taken over entire industries killing off competition driving out innovation squeezing out small businesses and American family farmers our first entrepreneurs are disappearing at a disturbing rate we have had decades
And I just believe that in the United States of America , we should be setting an example of how this is done that is in accordance with our values and our ideals as a country . And there are a lot of things going on right now that to me are tantamount to moral vandalism that this administration is doing which are undermining our values and undermining who I think we should be , which is a light to other nations about how these processes should work .
Congress must tell the president he cannot engage our troops in an illegal war in Syria . To allow this blatantly illegal action would spell the end of congressional authority over war . And it would offer incontrovertible evidence that the United States under President Trump is no longer a champion of the world order , but is ready and willing to tear it down .
first language I want to say to many of you many of you yo voy a hacer una Presidente para todo nuestra gente innuendo payees I will be a president for all people in America when I arrived here in Newark over 20 years ago to work as a tenant rights lawyer I found a city with challenges that some folk said were intractable but we in Newark refused to believe that any problem is too hard to solve if we
but I want to tell you right now I am running for president of the United States not because of him not because of one man in one office not because of his moral vandalism we don ' t win as Democrats when we run races about simply what we ' re against we win them when we talk about what we ' re for and who we ' re for and how we fight and so tonight I want to tell you I ' m running for president because I believe in us this is a moral moment in America don ' t

Senator Booker has worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to boost American responses to violent extremism , particularly in the digital and social media space . Senator Booker introduced a bipartisan measure , the Countering Online Recruitment of Violent Extremists Act , to leverage existing Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) resources to counter violent extremism online . Senator Booker also worked with Republican colleagues to co - author The Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act of 2016 which requires the president to prepare a report on terrorists ' and terrorist organizations ' use of social media and a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists ' and terrorist organizations ' use of social media .
Start with the Constitution . The founders created a system in which the power to declare war rests with Congress , not the president . The 1973 War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities in the absence of a declaration of war . The president must then terminate the use of armed forces within 60 days ( with 30 days for withdrawal ) unless Congress has declared war or otherwise authorized the use of military force .
hello Nevada so um hello Nevada look Mike my even my supporters we got to behave yourself because my mom is here right now I ' m proud that my mom isn ' t a dad and I ' m a proud that my grandparents lived in Nevada and I tell you this my dad died here it was during my primary to become a United States Senator my father had a stroke and went to a hospital right here in Las Vegas and I was distressed my mom told me don ' t leave
we can ' t wait when powerful forces are turning their prejudice into policy and rolling back the rights that generations of American fought for and heroes died for we can ' t wait when this administration is drawing children feel fleeing violence into cages banning Muslims from entering the nation founded on religious liberty and preventing brave transgender Americans from serving the country they love and we can ' t wait because many of our most

through heartbreak and pain and betrayal it ' s the kind of love that keeps on going and never gives up it ' s the kind of love that sacrifices the kind of love that is essential to achieving justice I learned right here on these streets that you can ' t make progress by dividing people it can ' t make progress by stoking fear or setting us one against the other I learned that the only way to overcome
of the anti - democratic forces you all are here because I know you joined my feeling to be dissatisfied that we live in a nation as my friend Brian Stevenson says that has a criminal justice system that treats you better if you ' re rich and guilty than if you ' re poor and innocent you all are dissatisfied like me that we live in a nation where millions of children find it easier to get unleaded gasoline than unleaded water you all are like me that you ' re
tackle it together we were a community impatient for justice Newark has always been a community impatient for justice a community that knew in the words of dr .

Joseph ' s brothers uttered when they saw him and his coat of many colors that dream interpreter and they grabbed him and they threw him into the well to die well there are many Americans now that feel isolated in a well if you like the promise of this country ring hollow with their experiences the question is will we be like Joseph who went from the pit to the palace and so right there were Martin Luther King shot have some words that

willful ignorance or dangerous tolerance of its presence in our society it manifests itself in a criminal justice system that arrests blacks at three times the rate of whites for drug - related crimes despite virtually no difference between whites and blacks in the frequency of dealing or using drugs it manifests itself in an immigration system that targets Latin X migrants fleeing violence and allows us to see them so much as the other that whedon
As president I will also insist that China honor the commitments it has made for the autonomy of Hong Kong , and will be a voice for the people of Hong Kong and their ability to organize and express their opinions .
people were luring people into homes who had no jobs and no income and they gave him cash at closing my record as a mayor my record as a senator is fighting those interests are trying to screw people and when it comes to defending folks I will be ferocious yes in the back let ' s be clear whatever you do when you ' re in elected office you ' re gonna get criticized you know when I was before I would got into elected office when I helped somebody

opposed to investing in the infrastructure that would keep our children safe and strong the most valuable natural resources country has is not oil or gas or coal it ' s the genius of our children if we ' re gonna compete in a 21 st century knowledge - based economy we should all be morally outraged outraged that so many of our children ' s minds be addled by lead levels that that should tear at the heart of all of us and so my I this is
human rights not coddle dictators or squander America ' s moral authority as commander in chief as commander in chief there is nothing I will take more seriously than the responsibility to protect our nation and and keep faith with the people who wear our uniform we call ourselves call ourselves the home of the brave but when our brave veterans come home we need to make sure that they have a home we will end
took me to see John Lewis who was so humble was so moving was telling me what it meant to him to see the fourth black person ever elected to the United States Senate this is what he said he fought for and stood for and then I left and I went to Harry Reid ' s office and he hugged me and he told me you will be a great senator and then he sent me out to the floor of the United States Senate where I got sworn in by Joe I ' ll never
You know , what ' s going on in our country right now with thousands of children being separated from their families is a kind of anguish and pain that people on both sides of the aisle are outraged and speaking out against . I think this is a moral moment . To put a political lens over it undermines - especially about an election that is not even the one in November but two years after that - really undermines what I think should be seen as a moral urgency for all Americans to be speaking up , to be taking extraordinary actions .
they ' ve actually increased putting our children at risk I ' m sorry it ' s it ' s easy to say I love America but love is not a word it is a his action is sacrifice in his work and and and if we ' re allowing our children to fall prey to lead or toxic sites with this rampant environmental justice that we see from the black belt of center of the south to the to the Great Lakes area it casts a shadow over all of us and so we need to come together now enough
walk here we are all here because Americans from different backgrounds different races different religions even different political parties stood together work together fought together to make this country stand for something what makes us unique and different is that we have folks from all over the planet Earth from Eastern Europe to Asia from Western Europe to Africa who DNA is now on this soil and by us working together we did things that other people
when our veterans when they come home are disproportionately homeless that we say we believe in liberty and justice for all but we are a nation that treats you better as my friend Bryan Stevenson says if you ' re rich and guilty than if you ' re poor and innocent this is an election where we have to see in this race it ' s about having a revival of civic grace it ' s about having a more crazy is empathy for one another it is
dissatisfied that in this great nation we have millions of people who work full - time jobs but dignity has been stripped of the work a tax on Union and you have more and more Americans now finding themselves with more month at the end of their money than money at the end of their you all just satisfied that we live a nation with the growth of corporate power has gotten so much that they are now finding ways as they have in the

I did . The Customs and Border Patrol officers readily admitted to me that that ' s what they do . They claimed it was based upon whether there was room in detention facilities for those families . But there are a lot of advocates who are saying that this is being done in many ways pushing people to try to cross through means which are not in accordance with the law and thereby trigger a different set of experiences . And that ' s problematic and something I ' ll explore more during my day today meeting with many officials down here .

humanize them we separate families we put children in cages nursing women or pregnant women on concrete floors it manifests itself in a health care system that disproportionately fails black and brown Americans that dismisses the pain of black women with deadly consequences and we ' re undocumented people in our nation are afraid to seek care in a crisis because they fear deportation and the twisted irony of this poison is its
always people with titles as I learned here in Newark the greatest leaders I ' ve ever met aren ' t in white houses or sentence or Congress ' s or or what have you there are people in communities neighbors who are strong on blocks tenant leaders who hold folks together the greatness of this country lies and our ability to be there for each other to extend grace and kindness and we need to start having a better celebration of those values in our nation especially

dangerous delusion that song amongst us or outside our moral concern that we don ' t have to care about those others we don ' t have to think about them that they should express their gratitude simply to be here an idea that some Americans can even be a threat to other Americans just by existing when in reality the story of America the truth of our nation is that we share a common cause a common purpose that there is only one singular American destiny as a political strategy

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently announced that American troops will remain in Syria even after the fight against the Islamic State has ended . If the administration carries through on this promise , it will commit the American people to an indefinite conflict that could bring our troops into direct confrontation with the armed forces of Syria and its closest allies , Iran and Russia . In the process , it will break just about every relevant law on the books .
violence and white supremacy against injustice and bigotry it ' s a place of forgiveness and healing a place of love strength and courage mother Emanuel knows all too well what it means to suffer at the hands of hatred and white supremacy and bigotry and today again unlike any other day we need leaders to stand against gun violence by supporting the bills that are out there we need leaders to speak out against hatred bigotry racism and we always welcome
In so clearly breaking international law , we would not just put our troops in harm ' s way ; we would also be licensing malevolent leaders the world over to follow in our footsteps . And we would be doing so when the world ' s approval of American leadership has dropped to a new low  ' down to 30 percent from 48 percent just a year earlier . This course of action would significantly undermine America ' s hard - earned global leadership as a champion of law - bound international action , perhaps irreparably .

organizing tenants who often had been iced felt isolated and separated by slum Lords who were not providing safe decent sanitary housing and we beat them because the power of the people of the power of the people is always greater than the people in power and so you all are here not because of an individual candidate in this election season can ' t be just about an individual office we have to talk about the deeper dissatisfaction in our country because
As repulsive as the regime of President Bashar al - Assad is , an American - backed attempt to prevent it from re - establishing control over Syrian territory , as Secretary Tillerson indicated , would embroil the United States in a new prolonged , bloody and increasingly complicated conflict . Indeed , Turkey ' s cross - border air and ground assaults in recent days on Afrin , a northern Syrian enclave held by American - supported Kurdish militias , demonstrate how fragile the situation is .

For several decades now , Congress has gradually ceded its war authority to the executive branch . If it does not act now , it may lose what authority remains . Congress has to attend to its constitutional duties : Our troops and their families deserve a public debate over the precise scope of their mission if we ' re asking them to put their lives on the line .
