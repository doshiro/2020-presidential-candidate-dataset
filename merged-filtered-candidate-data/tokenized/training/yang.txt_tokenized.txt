to train hundreds of young entrepreneurs to build businesses in Detroit Cleveland Baltimore and other communities across the country together we helped create thousands of jobs but during this time I came to realize that technology has already wiped out 4 million manufacturing jobs in Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania and other states and it ' s about to do the same thing to people who work in retail food service and food prep customer service transportation as
We also need to do more to get people out of their online bubbles and into local communities . We should investigate the impact of social media on our children and come up with guidelines on how much exposure is acceptable . All high school seniors should spend time traveling to a different part of the country to get exposed to different cultures .
Work with Congress to set automatic voter registration requirements for federal elections .
Set new standards and metrics for antitrust , including size of data assets and lack of business formation .
America ' s criminal justice system should be built around the idea of rehabilitation whenever possible  ' that means during the incarceration period and after . By restoring full voting rights to felons during incarceration , who have not deprived someone else of their right to vote , and ex - felons who have completed the entirety of their sentence , we ' ll increase their engagement with society . This will improve their lives drastically , for obvious reasons . It will also make the rest of us safer , as some studies have shown that ex - felons who vote are half as likely to reoffend . By giving these individuals a larger stake in society , we make our entire country stronger .

In order to regulate technology effectively , our government needs to understand it . It ' s embarrassing to see the ignorance some members of Congress display when talking about technology , and anyone who watched Congress question Mark Zuckerberg is well aware of this . Without a base level of understanding , it ' s unreasonable to expect proper regulation of major tech companies , or the drafting of legislation that addresses the critical technological issues that we ' ll continue to face in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity .

establish the American scorecard and present on how we are doing every year at the State of the Union so these are the three big ideas to get us through the greatest economic shift in human history and I ' m going to close with a conversation I had in Washington DC that will be familiar to some of you so I was going through these issues and saying look this is a giant technology shift and the American people are being devastated through no fault of their own
More than three - quarters of older voters between the ages of 65 and 74 are registered to vote , and more than 60 % of those aged 85 and above cast a ballot in the 2016 election . 13 Despite large voter turnout of the elderly population , who take their civic duty seriously , stringent identification laws are making it more and more difficult for them to participate in the voting process . Whether that means finding transportation to renew their expired driver ' s license or scrambling to find a birth certificate that was issued 80 years ago , older voters are also becoming targets of disenfranchisement .
Strict voter identification requirements across the country are depriving many voters of their right to vote . Of course , the lawmakers who write these laws and voters who use their identification in their everyday lives don ' t think this is a big deal . However , low - income households , the elderly , transgender individuals , minorities , and people with disabilities ( PWD ) are more likely to be disenfranchised by these laws because they are more likely to experience difficulty obtaining the underlying documents necessary . 3 . 6 % of registered white voters lacked proper ID , compared to 7 . 5 % of black registrants . 8 The transgender community is disproportionately affected by these laws . 57 % ( approximately 78 , 000 ) of transgender people may not have identification or documentation that accurately reflects their gender , making them ineligible to vote . 9
Require states to provide address registration alternatives for reservation residents .
again so those are the numbers that is the story the numbers are telling us and this is the challenge of our era now the question is what are we going to do about it the problem is this big and the answer is as John alluded to we must fundamentally shift the way we perceive work and value in our society and I have a three - part plan to make this happen and solve for the greatest issue that threatens our way of life today now the first is the freedom dividend where
Require platforms that are market players and market platforms to maintain an even playing field for competitor products or services on their platforms , or exit the market .
Provide states with the funds necessary to ensure that all polling locations and voting methods are accessible to PWD .
We need to work with state licensing boards , and other organizations that are involved in certifications , to ensure that those who are trained by the military can seamlessly transition to a job in the civilian economy that they are qualified for . CDLs and EMT certifications , as well as paramedic and nurse , and other jobs that require certification , should all see a much easier transition from practicing them in the military and being employed in that job outside of service .
you have in your hands even though you don ' t always feel it day to day because you are fighting the fight but I ' m going to tell you that you are some of the most powerful people in this country and that we are all going to come to you and ask you for your support and that ' s what I ' m doing here tonight but together if we work our hearts out we can show our fellow Americans that we still live in a democracy that people matter more than money that our values are more powerful
Our citizens must be able to cast their votes without fear that they will be compromised by foreign hackers or lost by bad software . We must recognize that the greatest opportunity to prevent voter misrepresentation lies in updating outdated infrastructure . By freeing states from reliance on decades - old machines that were phased out in other states for poor security and clumsy user interface , we can build a safer , easier voting process .
Limit Voter Roll Purges
Reverse Boot Camp
Without real accountability , platforms like Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram are ignoring the negative impact of their services on our children . As the father of two young boys , I worry about what this will mean for the generations growing up with these technologies . Our kids have access from infancy . They ' re getting glued on apps and devices that are functioning as dopamine slot machines .
We are beginning to understand exactly how much of an adverse effect some of these new technologies are having on the well - being of society , especially on our children .

Work with allies abroad to combat the rise of white nationalism
Even though Ukraine is not a NATO member , that relationship is an important one , and I ' d work with our NATO allies to reaffirm and expand our security coordination with Ukraine . It was encouraging to hear Pres . Zelensky ' s words during his visit to NATO headquarters .
Providing all other services to increase the stability veterans feel , and ensuring a successful transition to civilian life , should help decrease veteran suicide . But there ' s more we can do to combat this scourge .

last time you heard a politician even read the words fourth Industrial Revolution just now right and I am barely a politician these are the problems that god Donald Trump elected and this is what you must solve this is how you must use your power now I want you all to ask yourselves for a moment how was a man you ' ve never heard of eight months ago speaking after Joe Biden and before Elizabeth Warren how did a man you never heard of before
Today , we live in a hyper - connected environment , led by these tech companies , that has impacted our culture , lifestyles , families , and politics . The culture of innovation and the quality of human capital in America has fostered the growth of this industry over the past couple of decades to create trillion - dollar tech companies , in a framework of self - regulation .
Reverse the damage we ' ve done . Research needs to be done on removing carbon from our atmosphere , cooling the planet and rejuvenating ecosystems .
Currently , different departments of the federal government consider digital assets as property , commodities , or securities . Some states have onerous regulations in the space , such as New York ' s BitLicense . Navigating this has had a chilling effect on the US digital asset market .
We need to come up with 21 st century solutions to these problems .
Implement and fund a voluntary buyback program , funded with a starting seed of $ 200 million but increasing based on the success of the program .
Stop the spread of misinformation that is eroding trust in our institutions and fanning the flames of polarization in our society . I will scale up VAT on digital ads to hasten a shift away from ad - driven business models , require disclosures on all ads , regulate bot activity , and regulate algorithms , addressing the grey area between publishers and platforms .
Invest millions in nonprofits such as Life After Hate and Free Radicals that help individuals disengage from white nationalist groups .
Separately , loot boxes are a mechanism in games where digital items can be purchased to add to the experience , but they ' re done in a  ' blind ' manner ' you don ' t know what you ' re receiving until after you pay for it . These mechanisms can seem similar to gambling because of the random outcome , keeping players ( usually kids ) engaged on the platform for longer or costing them hundreds or thousands of dollars in addition to the base cost of the game . Some games have a  ' free - to - play ' model , where the game itself is free but they ' re funded by the purchase of these loot boxes .
Loot boxes are impacting our children , causing them to spend more time and money on these video games , without many parents being aware of their existence .
Create a Department of the Attention Economy that focuses specifically on how to responsibly design and use smartphones , social media , gaming , and chat apps . It will include overall guidelines , as well as age - based ones .
Our system doesn ' t just force us to make moral compromises , it makes it almost impossible for 3 rd party candidates to run without damaging the campaigns of like - minded parties , and pushes more extreme fringe ideas to the top by minimizing coalition building .
2 . Minimize health impacts of modern tech on our people , especially our children
The qualified courses of study should also be expanded to allow for more varied career pursuits after service , while also providing protections for our veterans from for - profit institutions that wouldn ' t provide a significant chance of employment after graduation , certification , or completion of the course . Any institution that receives tuition through this program should be required to report on employment numbers and be held accountable if they ' re not meeting certain standards .
Looking to the future of voting , we must consider what options we have to make voting more secure and accessible . My administration will research developments in e - voting , including mobile voting . If this technology proves truly secure and viable , its use would dramatically boost voter participation and reduce the costs of local , state and national elections .

reason it passed the house and not the Senate was that Democrats in the Senate wanted an even higher income threshold and someone who worked in democratic politics at that time told me was the biggest screwup that they ' d ever made and if they ' d just taken that deal every family united states have been guaranteed a certain level of income from 1971 till today can you imagine if they had made that move then 11 years later once they did pass the dividend
My vision of the future for American healthcare involves covering everyone  ' even veterans  ' under a Medicare for All - style program . However , the VA would still have a role in veteran health in this system , transitioning to a focus on veteran - specific issues ( prosthetics , chronic ailments related to battlefield injury , mental health and PTSD ) and maintaining expertise in these areas .
As President I will '
greatest economic and technological transition in the history of mankind Donald Trump is the manifestation of this transition and our government has been decades behind in being honest about it and addressing it now before I deciding to run for president I decided to try and talk to various political leaders about the fact that this is the core set of issues and what do you think their responses to me were go ahead and shout them out was it
6 . 1 million Americans cannot vote due to a felony conviction and are therefore denied the right to cast their vote in an election . Felony disenfranchisement exacerbates racial disparities . 1 in 13 black Americans have lost their right to vote vs . 1 in 56 white Americans . 24 State laws vary wildly as far as re - enfranchisement is concerned , with some never disenfranchising felons , and others permanently disenfranchising them . This patchwork of state laws is inherently unfair , as citizens are treated differently depending on their location .
If our data is being used , we need to know how it ' s being used and how we ' re being compensated for it . We also need to regain control of it when we want . By implementing measures to increase transparency in the data collection and monetization process , individuals can begin to reclaim ownership of what ' s theirs .
A candidate who runs their campaign on Democracy Dollars will have no debts to pay to special interests when they take office . They can act primarily in the interest of the people they represent instead of appeasing wealthy donors and corporations .
profoundly imagine beyond the look your teenage son or daughter in the in the eye and say starting at age 18 you will receive $ 1 , 000 a month from your country because your country loves you your country values you and you are just as American as everyone else that is profound right now what are we saying to our young people we ' re saying you can vote maybe and then they look up they see the system with pipes clogged full of money hundreds of millions of dollars
Refuse to hire anyone who formerly worked as a lobbyist for any gun rights or gun manufacturing organization in my Administration .

Native American Voting Rights
started a nonprofit called venture for America that helped create thousands of jobs and cities like Detroit Cleveland st . Louis Baltimore and you know I saw during these seven years I saw millions of young people who are not starting families let alone businesses because they couldn ' t pay their bills I saw millions of young people who were buried under a mountain of debt and trapped in their parents basements

Provisional Ballots
Require large , clear labeling on all advertisements shown on an online platform .
Work with Congress to adopt ranked - choice voting for all federal elections .
For many Americans , guns are a big part of their culture and identity . That must be respected . However , guns are a major responsibility and thus we need to have common - sense gun safety measures , especially considering that there are already approaching 400 million firearms in the United States . Responsible gun owners should continue to enjoy the right to bear arms , subject to licensing and education requirements that will enhance public safety . But we need to ban the most dangerous weapons that make mass shootings as deadly as they have become .
All schools should also have clear and flexible policies for enrollment and withdrawal for veterans and active servicemembers . These policies should include :
Mandate that all platforms have the option to use their service without collecting data or personal information on the user .
We ' re also largely alone in this . We have a number of guns per capita at least twice as high as the next highest country , and three times the one after that . We have the highest per capita gun suicide rate , and some sources have us in the top ten for total gun deaths per capita . And mass shootings are significantly more common in the United States
We ' ve also seen it abused . Some companies haven ' t done enough to protect our data , resulting in breaches that have made our private information insecure . Others have sold it to disreputable companies , allowing them to target us for everything from marketing fraudulent services to influencing elections . Companies themselves have asked for better and clearer rules . This breach in American privacy and data security requires regulation of ongoing data collection .
Helping with their transition to civilian life and increasing employment and stability is a huge step in decreasing the number of situationally homeless veterans . Improving mental health resources and treatment is a huge step in combating chronic homelessness .

Increase assistance to single parents .
Translating military skills to civilian skills
Once the government is up to speed on technology , and measures have been implemented to curb the negative effects on society , we must ensure that control over the most powerful technologies in history don ' t accrue in the hands of a few . However , we must recognize that 20 th century frameworks of breaking up companies just based on size or pricing impact on consumers won ' t be effective . Network effects will always ensue , as a dominant player invariably emerges . And no one wants to use the fourth best search engine .
We also need to help veterans afford housing through financial literacy , assistance in saving up for a down payment or security deposit ( including by instituting programs while they ' re still in active service , to dedicate portions of their pay specifically to retirement and post - discharge housing ), mortgage options , and , if it comes to it , assistance in foreclosure proceedings ( including incentives for mortgage companies to find alternatives to foreclosures ).
Ensure all schools receive training on identifying children who are in crisis and providing them with assistance .
I ' m a parent of two young boys . I want to look them in their eyes every day when they walk out our front door and be able to tell them that they ' re safe .

The myth of voter fraud can make it more difficult for millions of Americans to participate in the voting process and exacerbates voter suppression . Combating voter suppression requires limiting voter roll purges , prohibiting voter ID laws , limiting last minute changes to polling locations , implementing automatic and same - day voter registration , accepting mail - in ballots , requiring early voting , and counting all provisional ballots .
working much harder than I am and those of you who have kids at home raise your hand if you have kids at home most of you got to be more parents than that my wife is at home with our young boys who were five and two one of whom has special needs and she ' s working much much harder than I do what does GDP value her work at right now zero and we all know that ' s nonsense we know that she ' s contributing much more value than the average hedge fund
Processes to change names or gender markers on identification can be expensive , difficult , and vary from state to state . For individuals who do not have traditional identification like a driver ' s license or passport , states are legally required to provide a process for them to obtain some form of voter ID . However , states can purposely make it difficult to obtain voter ID by severely limiting the days that their ID offices are open . The most extreme example includes a location in Sauk County , Wisconsin where the office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month 10 ( which equates to four days of the entire year ).
As President , I will '

President Trump has been vilifying and scapegoating immigrants . He ' s been running ads that call the situation at the southern border a migrant  ' invasion .  ' Telling people to go back where they came from , calling other countries  ' sh * tholes ', and joking about shooting migrants as they approach the border are all dehumanizing and incitements to violence .
Returning Heroes Initiative
I ' m ashamed of the world we are leaving to our kids this is why I ' m running for president Virginia we have to let our fellow Americans know what the real problems are so that we can solve them Donald Trump getting him out of office will not make all of these problems go away artificial intelligence is still going to get faster and smarter the robot trucks are going to come closer to the
Helping Ukraine will also help us prepare for Russian aggression . The Russian interference in Ukrainian elections was a precursor to their interference in US elections . By helping neighboring states to Russia defend themselves , we ' re also learning how to defend ourselves .

This is a New Way Forward .
We need to increase our influence and alliances across the Pacific , so I believe we need to either enter the TPP , or negotiate a similar deal to combat the rising influence of China in the region . We should take this opportunity to renegotiate labor and environmental standards , and intellectual property and data protection , specifically in the tech sector .
The effects are worrying . There has been an unprecedented surge in depression , 10 anxiety , and suicide , and a marked decrease in sociability . Teenagers are spending more time worrying about whether their online acquaintances like their recent post than spending time with their friends in person and developing social skills . The average teenager spends Friday nights at home , interacting with a machine , instead of being out with friends .

Many Americans are taking time off from work to vote , only to experience absurd lines , understaffed polling stations , and hassles with voter ID requirements . Mail - in ballots and early voting not only help the working - class American , but also those who are unable to make it to a polling station , including but not limited to the ill , physically disabled , or those working poll stations .
While I ' m in favor of legalizing marijuana at the federal level , if that takes time , we need to provide waivers for veterans so they can receive this treatment , as well as prescribe it through the VA . This includes waivers and prescriptions for veterans residing in states that currently don ' t allow for personal use or medical exceptions for marijuana use .
was heading to the coasts and not to places like Iowa including people who were from places like Iowa many many times they thought they had to leave for better opportunities and so that was the problem that I saw and I said we can do something about that so I donated 120 , 000 my own money he started calling rich friends and said do you love America and then the savvy among them said what does it mean if I say yes to that question
We need to be very careful not to infringe on the First Amendment rights of individuals , but we also need to work to minimize the spread of incitements to violence on social media channels and websites .
As of now , that data is owned by the people who collect it , and they ' re allowed to do anything they want with it . They ' ve sold it , used it to target us with advertisements , and have analyzed the vast quantity of data to draw conclusions on whole populations , allowing them to monetize it . At this rate , the extraction of personal data is America ' s fastest growing industry , worth $ 197 . 7 billion by 2022 . 7

Ending Veteran Suicide
We can help parents stay together by providing tax credits for anyone who wishes to go to marriage counseling , and provide resources for single parents who often struggle to both work and raise their children . We need to implement a paid family leave policy so that families have more time to bond .
The United States must promote free and fair elections in Venezuela to determine their next leader . The most recent elections were obviously marred by fraud , intimidation , and voter suppression .
Ranked - Choice Voting : Aligning Our Votes with Our Values
With modern communication channels , messages travel wide and fast . Trump may not specifically incite anyone to a violent act , but continually dehumanizing other people and using violent imagery and jokes will result in some people who have a preexisting tendency towards violence to take up arms and lash out .

Support passage of the Native American Voting Rights Act to extend greater federal support for Native American and Alaska Native voters .
The United States must take action against Saudi Arabia given the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi . That violent and illegal action against someone living in the United States must not go unanswered . It also hints at the larger conflict of values between our two countries . While we must be pragmatic in our foreign policy in recognizing that we will often have to deal with countries that have bad values , we should also be sure to always let our values lead us . A reset of the relationship with Saudi Arabia under this understanding would prevent us from getting involved in another conflict like the one in Yemen by centering our diplomacy around our values and ideals .
There are many issues unique to the veteran community that we need to address . The transition to civilian life should be smoother , and we need to put more support structures in place . Public misconceptions have lead to issues with employment . Homelessness is a perennial problem , and the VA  ' especially the Veterans Health Administration  ' can do much more to improve the well - being of those who have served .

that you could pay your bills and do everything that you would do with a thousand dollars more per month and would create over 40 , 000 jobs in Iowa immediately now this is a very very big plan and a big move but it ' s something that we can achieve because again you determine the future of this country and we need to build an economy that actually puts human goals and values front and center invest in our people and build a trickle up economy the
The GI Bill is one of our best ways to thank the brave individuals who serve this country . While this benefit program provides flexibility and training to our veterans as they transition to civilian life , there are ways that it can be improved to make this transition easier .
Substance abuse treatment should be expanded , with more available treatment centers and long - term support , as helping with addiction issues will reduce many other issues for veterans ( homelessness , unemployment , suicide ). The same should be true for general mental health care .
Push the DNC to adopt a ranked - choice voting model for all democratic primaries .

Russian aggression in Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law , and we have the obligation to work with our allies to act . We need to echo the chorus of our allies in stating that Russia must return to its borders , and we won ' t recognize any expansion they have into neighboring territories . Russian aggression is a destabilizing force , and we must work with our allies to project a strong and unified face against Russian expansionism .
We should make Election Day a federal holiday on the second Tuesday of every November . Doing so will dramatically increase voter turnout and the voice of the American people in government .
The right to be informed if ownership of your data changes hands
Voter purging disenfranchises legitimate voters and can create confusion and delays in the voting process . Purging has increased by 33 % over the last decade , mainly in counties with an established voting discrimination history . In 2015 , Alabama alone purged 16 % of it ' s nearly 4 million registered voters . 3 We need to take steps that ensure that every eligible American vote can cast their ballot on Election Day .

However , studies show that only 20 % of manufacturing job loss is due to trade with China . The other 80 % can be attributed to automation . While we need to take steps to ensure that our trade deals work for all Americans , automation is the bigger threat .
Establish a Digital Bill of Rights that clearly outlines how data is allowed to be collected and used .
the three and a half million truckers in this country or the seven million Americans who work at truckstops motels and diners that rely upon the truck stopping every day the Democrats are acting like Donald Trump is the source of all of our problems he is not he is a symptom he ' s a manifestation of the fact that we ' re going through the greatest economic transformation in our country ' s history what experts are calling the fourth
While America has undoubtedly made mistakes , we ' ve been a positive force in world history , leading to the spread of peace , prosperity , and democracy . Presidents from JFK to Ronald Reagan maintained strong relationships with allies while sending clear and honest messages to those who would work against us .
Over the past several decades , we have engaged in conflicts that have cost us trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives . These misadventures have destabilized parts of the world , made enemies of allies , and resulted in untold human suffering , both for our brave soldiers and civilians of other countries .

We need to put control of our democracy back in the hands of the people , and we need our politicians to reflect the will of the constituencies they represent . If we don ' t remove the politics from the drawing of district maps for voting purposes , we ' ll continue to have representative bodies that don ' t actually represent the population and promote the agenda of a smaller and smaller proportion of the population .
Provide a tax credit that covers marriage counseling for every couple that wants it .
While the 2018 midterm elections saw the highest turnout in a non - presidential year since 1914 , the turnout was still under 50 %. Presidential election turnout hovers between 50 % and 65 %. This is low . While reforms making it easier to vote should be implemented as well , we can also increase civic engagement and regular voting by lowering the voting age .
what are we going to do about it and this is what someone said to me he said to me you are in the wrong town that this town is not a town of leaders this is a town of laggards and followers we will be the last people to figure this out and what you must do Andrew is you must create a wave in other parts of the country and bring it crashing down on our heads and only then will we understand and that is why I ' m with you

Fund Ballot Box Security
All the while , they ' ve been preventing the confirmation of any judge that would allow gun control legislation to be ruled unconstitutional . Our federal judiciary has been transformed over the past few years to the point where it will be difficult to overcome judicial activism in expanding the radical and expansive interpretation of the 2 nd Amendment that has only recently taken hold after decades of lobbying by the NRA .
Implementing Common Sense Gun Safety Laws
Establish a provisional ballots guideline for all states to follow to ensure all legitimate ballots are accounted for , and that there are the same guidelines in each state .
going to be alright thank you very much Iowa let ' s make history let ' s move the country forward together in 2020 and win this whole thing I love Iowa I love it here you
Identification problems should not bar Americans from voting . We must remove discriminatory voter ID laws that deny thousands of otherwise eligible citizens the opportunity to participate in the democratic process .
paying zero or near zero and now think about what does what $ 1 , 000 a month would actually mean in your hands in the hands of your friends and neighbors it would mean lower stress levels it would mean fewer arguments with your spouse it would mean being able to tire with dignity it would mean not having to choose between car repairs and new clothes for your kids it ' s not about the money it is about what it means to us and I ' ve been giving a thousand dollars
Assist companies in detecting bots and penalize them if they don ' t meet minimum effectiveness thresholds at regulating the spread of information , especially from foreign actors .
It ' s impossible to be a leader when you have no allies , and so we need to rebuild our relationships with the rest of the world . Leveraging these relationships , we can more effectively deal with international issues . Working with our allies will make us stronger and more able to accomplish our goals over time .

Homelessness disproportionately affects veterans . This is unacceptable , and I commit to decreasing it substantially during my first term as President .
4 . A modern approach to antitrust and regulation requires a 21 st century framework
This voter discrimination cannot be tolerated . The federal government needs to set nationwide standards for our federal elections to ensure that no eligible voter is prevented from voting . The following initiatives are targeted at combating specific voter suppression practices enacted in both federal and state elections across the country .
Notify voters who have been purged in a timely manner so they can correct the error before the next election .
As President I will '
As President , I will '
To preserve our national values and ensure our government functions properly , we must fight to guarantee that every American has not only the right to vote , but the resources to exercise those rights .
However , onerous matching requirements of names or signatures have led to the rejection of thousands of legitimate votes . Legal , financial , and societal barriers do not always make legal name changes easy . These requirements create barriers to people with disabilities , women who have married or divorced , and transgender people . In Florida , over 5 , 000 vote by mail ballots were rejected for signature requirements . 16 In Georgia ' s gubernatorial race , hundreds of absentee ballots were rejected without first giving voters a chance to fix the problem because of suspected signature mismatches . 17 Young voters are also more likely to have their mail - in ballots rejected because they did not use their handwriting enough to develop a steady signature . 18
In order to combat the development of fossil fuel power expanding to developing countries , we have to provide a viable alternative . China is currently using its Belt and Road Initiative to invest in projects in developing nations to create economic and cultural bonds between their countries ; we have to provide a cleaner and more democratic alternative .
Defining what a token is , and when it is a security
To build trust in government , we need to get big money out of politics for good , and allow voters to elect representatives that reflect their values , not the lesser of two evils . Perception is important , and when Americans realize the power they hold in shaping our nation ' s future , we will have a country built of political participants instead of political spectators .
Finally , the federal government should provide resources to veteran - run businesses . This can take the form of initial investment , low - cost financing options , and preferential treatment .
Voter suppression policies like voter ID laws , voter roll purges , limited polling locations , and onerous signature matching requirements are typically justified as a way to combat voter fraud . Here ' s the problem : voter fraud is practically nonexistent . An American is more likely to get struck by lightning than commit voter fraud . 1 99 . 9 % of  ' voter fraud ' cases investigated turn out to be administrative or clerical errors .

It ' s unacceptable that we continue to have exceptionally high levels of gun violence and our government can ' t even enact common - sense reforms that have overwhelming popular support . Our children are doing active shooting drills in school , and we ' re doing nothing to make them feel safer .
No matter how safe and effective voting machines are , they won ' t have any effect unless voters have access to them . Voting security cannot only be practiced by the federal government , it must happen at every level . To connect voters with secure , well - maintained machines and functioning polling stations , the federal government must give states the resources they need to procure and install this technology at every voting station . We must also fund more post - election audits to detect any attempts to interfere in the democratic process .
Africa ' s youth population is driving the adoption of new technologies at awesome speeds . Cell phones are now prevalent on a continent where wired phones never took hold . Adopting renewable energy now will allow Africa to avoid the shortfalls that come from having a centralized grid .
Cryptocurrencies and digital assets have quickly grown to represent a large amount of value and economic activity , outstripping government ' s response . A national framework for regulating these assets has failed to emerge , with several federal agencies claiming conflicting jurisdictions .
I have met with several veteran groups and one vet told me something profound .  ' It ' s not that employers just aren ' t pro - veteran . They are actually looking for reasons to say no and rule you out because they think you ' re damaged goods .  '
The language that our leaders use matters . When our leaders use violent messaging , it increases the likelihood that their supporters will take violent action .
Working to ensure that licensing and certification standards transfer between military and civilian jobs is just a start to ensuring that we do everything we can to help veterans find and maintain employment . But there ' s a lot more we need to do .
Include classes on the responsible use of technology in public school curricula and teach children how to distinguish reliable from unreliable news sources online .
In short , many experts are worrying that the widespread adoption of a poorly understood technology has caused mental health and developmental problems for an entire generation . We can ' t just accept that our kids aren ' t all right ' we need to do something about it .
Require polling stations to be located within 20 miles of reservations .
It ' s also causing other risks to health . Studies have found adverse associations between screen time and sleep deprivation . 11 Extended screen time has also been linked with obesity in children . The health of our kids , and potentially of generations after , are at risk . We must take action .
Global economic development has been our greatest foreign policy accomplishment . This success started with the Marshall Plan , providing billions in economic aid to rehabilitate European economies regardless of which side of the war the countries fought on . This initiative resulted in the promotion of free trade , modern technologies , the spread of democracy , and stronger allies to partner with the US in our global initiatives . We have continued to promote sustainable economic development across the globe by working closing with and empowering international development organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . When our global initiatives promote open markets , in turn , we promote freedom everywhere .
Finally , we need to expand sanctions against Russia , and Putin and members of his government specifically through the Global Magnitsky Act , in order to pressure the country to play by international rules .
As the leader of the free world , Trump knows his messages carry great weight . He needs to reflect on what he ' s doing and realize that what he says can cause these horrific acts to occur . It doesn ' t seem that he ' s capable of that level of self - reflection .
The only way we can possibly minimize the loss of life due to white nationalism - inspired domestic terrorism is to provide a way for those who are entrenched in this hateful world to leave , if they desire .

to run for president of the United States because I am not insane I worked in the Obama administration I went to Washington DC and I said what are we going to do to help our fellow citizens understand that it is not immigrants that are causing these problems it is technology and an economy that is pushing more and more of us to decide and the folks in Washington DC had very little to offer but one of them gave me some guidance that led me here to you
White nationalist terrorism has accounted for over 70 % of terrorism - related deaths in the US over the past decade . Some organizations have stated that the number of white nationalist perpetrators of terrorist attacks has quadrupled since 2016 . There is widespread agreement between law enforcement officials , both in the US and throughout Europe , that white nationalist and far - right terrorism are on the rise . Law enforcement agencies in the United States have had an increasing number of interactions with these groups , resulting in the deaths of dozens of brave men and women over the past several decades .
Climate change is big , and it is scary . It ' s destabilizing the world , and it ' s costing American lives .

Trade deals have inarguably hurt a large number of Americans . By outsourcing American jobs - particularly manufacturing jobs to China - we ' ve devastated communities and placed large amounts of financial stress on families .
We need to expand the electorate and ensure access to the ballot box for every American . We will protect the integrity of our democratic process through the elimination of discriminatory laws and initiatives to increase voter participation across the board .
Prohibit Voter ID Laws

On top of the financial literacy training , there also needs to be laws put in place so that veterans are protected from payday lenders and other predatory businesses . This would involve creating zones around bases where these businesses couldn ' t operate , lending institutions specifically for veterans that could provide financial assistance if needed coupled with more financial literacy training , and financial assistance for veterans who are having difficulty paying off predatory loans .
Appoint Supreme Court justices who support the use of sociological tools such as the efficiency gap to help end partisan gerrymandering .
The internet and social media have made it much easier to spread hateful ideas and ideologies . Dark corners of the web like 4 chan and 8 chan regularly see vile ideas shared and laughed at , and mass shooters will frequently post their manifestos to these sites . They also see commentary that cheers the shooters along and encourages others to commit violence . Social media services also see violent videos shared , such as when the New Zealand mass murder was streamed on Facebook .
2 . Would you rejoin the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA )? What changes to the existing agreement , if any , would you require before agreeing to rejoin the accord ?
The reverse boot camp would ensure that all veterans are aware of the general  ' timeline ' of issues they ' ll face . Recent veterans face different challenges than those who have been out of the armed services for a longer time period . For example , immediately after their discharge from the military , veterans often face issues with adjusting to a self - directed schedule and finding a new career , issues which are resolved over time .
country needs and needs it very very bad this country does not understand what is happening we ' re in the third inning of the greatest economic and technological transformation in the history of our country and who are we blaming immigrants it ' s ridiculous it ' s stupid and what we have to do is we have to wake up our fellow Americans to the fact that it is not immigrants that are causing these economic problems it ' s the Amazon black hole it ' s technology
Two - thirds of states now offer some form of early voting , 14 giving Americans the ability to cast their ballots at less crowded polling stations and with reduced wait times . This provides significant relief to poll workers and increases voter turnout , especially of underrepresented populations .
Veterans Health Initiative
put the money in our hands the money in our head put the money in our head can we afford it cause inflation is it awesome yeah anyone trying to make it happen
America has been in a constant state of war for over 18 years . We have people who can vote in elections who have known nothing but war . We need to do everything in our power to end our current conflicts and prevent ourselves from getting embroiled in future open - ended conflicts with no clear benefit to the US . That ' s why I ' ve signed the pledge to End the Forever Wars . The US people are sick of paying trillions of dollars and seeing thousands die without feeling any safer .
We should continue to support the Venezuelan people with humanitarian aid , and also assist our regional allies in dealing with the crisis of the massive number of refugees . And we should signal that we will provide aid to Venezuela after a transition to a new and democratically elected government .
My approach is 4 - pronged :
Require platforms to provide guidance on kid - healthy content for parents , and provide incentives for companies that work to make user data of minors available to their parents .
The right to be informed as to what data will be collected , and how it will be used
This way of voting has been shown to increase voter turnout , better reflect voter values , encourage moderate politics , and decrease negative campaigning . With ranked - choice voting in place , we will no longer have to vote for the lesser of evils , but for the better of leaders .
Place a higher VAT on digital advertisements in order to incentivize companies to shift to an ad - free , subscription model .
Same - day registration is another form of modernized voter registration that enables eligible citizens to submit their ballots with more ease . 21 states have enacted same - day registration , 6 which allows any qualified resident of the state to go to register to vote and cast a ballot all on the same day . States that have implemented this option have seen a 3 % to 7 % increase in voter turnout . 7
It ' s right to embrace technology and all the conveniences and advantages that come with its advancement , but we can ' t do it at the cost of our humanity . At the core of our technology use , needs to be our well - being and that of future generations . We owe it to ourselves to pursue a new way forward in this technology - driven era , while we still can .
We can make the United States the center of a new global , sustainable energy sector . This will bring money to the American people , and will create jobs in installation and maintenance that will be local and less likely to be automated . It will also reduce a primary source of income used by some of our biggest adversaries ( Russia , Iran , Venezuela all rely on oil , and terrorist organizations utilize it as a primary fundraising mechanism ). We can save the world for our children , make the environment healthier , and build a much stronger economy . We need to come together and get back to what America is all about  ' innovation , hard work , and solving the biggest problems the world is facing .
22 veterans commit suicide every day . That number is 22 too high , and I commit to decreasing it at least by half by the end of my first term as President .
The government should work with social media companies to combat the spread of violent rhetoric online , especially those that depict actual incidences of violence or call for specific acts of violence .
The treatment of the Uighurs in China is unacceptable , and we need to be a part of the chorus of voices across the world calling the situation out for what it is . It ' s also troubling to see China take a more aggressive stance throughout the region , whether towards Hong Kong , Taiwan , or in the South China Sea .
impossible the first thing is I ' m going to convince you that things are even worse than you think they are now you ' re all listening to this being like no way he ' s gonna be able to pull that off but I ' m gonna pull it off the second thing is I ' m going to present a way forward and the third is I ' m going to let you know that the country needs you all more than ever right now so how am I going to tell you all the things we ' ve been worse than you think there
The biggest mistake was not investing in and becoming a global leader in renewable energy technology . Climate change is a destabilizing force in a world that could use more stability . A lot of our primary antagonists have economies based largely on oil exports , and the sale of oil has also been used to fund terrorism . Infrastructure programs focusing on energy generation have allowed other countries - especially China - to form relationships with countries , often by exporting dirty energy technology . If the United States had invested heavily in renewables over the past few decades and engaged in an aggressive policy of exporting it to the rest of the world , particularly developing nations , we could have slowed or reversed climate change , cut off a funding source for regimes that we ' ve ended up fighting wars with , and made it much harder for terrorist organizations to fund themselves .
I look back at my childhood and I remember riding a bike around the neighborhood , but now tablets , computers , and mobile devices have shifted the attention of youth . Today , more than half of children aged 8 - 12 have their own tablet and a quarter of them have their own smartphone . 9
Pass a Democracy Dollars bill , putting over $ 20 b directly in the hands of the American people to support politicians they agree with and drown out the influence of lobbyists .
America ' s confidence in the value of a vote is dependent on trust in our institutions and the security of the infrastructure that make our elections possible . It is imperative that there is adequate funding directed to election security and the ongoing research necessary to keep our elections fair and free .
Partisan gerrymandering has plagued our nation for generations , and is a threat to the very basis of our democracy . By manipulating district lines to separate different voting blocks , parties are able to maintain control of state legislatures , even when a large majority of the state supports the other party .
fantasize about being president I am running for president because like so many of you in this room I ' m a parent and I ' m a patriot I have seen the future that lies ahead for our children and it is not something I am willing to accept here in Iowa you actually know what the future holds if you look up you saw it happen to your farms and then your factories now it ' s on your Main streets soon it will hit your highways it is up to you and you alone to turn the tide
same way they ' re just different things but we need to team up in the biggest way the country needs your moral leadership and authority more than ever right now and if you bring the moral leadership I will bring the math I will be the guy who beats Donald Trump in 2020 we will take this case all the way to the White House and win because the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math thank you all very much now a national network thank you
The most concerning of all is the effect technology and social media platforms are having on our kids . Technology , smartphones , and tablets are ubiquitous . Our kids have access to them from infancy . They ' re getting hooked , from a young age , on apps and platforms that function as dopamine slot machines , potentially destroying the psyches of a generation . It ' s affecting our kids ' mental and physical health , contributing to obesity , sleep deprivation , posture issues , stunting social skills , and blurring the lines between real and virtual relationships . It ' s time to take action .
More Than A Handshake : My Plan to Better Serve Our Veterans
families and your communities up this is the opposite of the trickle - down garbage that ' s been weakening us for years to and this is the vision this is the mission this is what we ' re going to make real in the days to come my campaign just raised ten million dollars last quarter cheapest Bernie ' s I love you for
would be excited about that you ' d be excited about because right now we ' re pushing you in certain directions and not others so I spent seven years traveling the country as the head of a non - profit I ' d start adventure for America got honored by the Obama administration so I got to meet the president I was blown away by the disparities between some parts of this country and others I have the sense of many of you
We also need to increase the funding and reach of crisis lines to ensure that any veteran has immediate access to individuals who can direct them to mental health services , or to a mental health professional who can provide immediate counseling and treatment .
and then I said at least $ 10 , 000 and then enough of them said I love America where we launched with a budget of about a quarter million today our budgets about 25 times larger thousands of young people have joined MIT or applied to venture for America and hundreds have headed to cities around the country to help create businesses and help businesses grow so that ' s what I ' ve been up to for the last seven years I ' m an entrepreneur and a problem solver who
Establish a centralized location to aggregate statistics on white nationalism and domestic terrorism , possibly through an expansion of the FBI ' s UCR .
Despite the $ 380 million round of grants given to states last year by the federal Elections Assistance Commission , 30 states need much more to cover all the costs that voting security demands . For example , to replace all electronic paperless voting machines in Pennsylvania , it is estimated they will need $ 50 . 4 to $ 79 . 1 million statewide , 31 far more than the $ 13 . 5 million provided by Congress . My administration will make it clear in Pennsylvania and every other state that money isn ' t an obstacle to a secure democracy .
Direct the Department of Justice to prepare and publicly release an Annual Report on Domestic Terrorism , in order to ensure all Americans are properly informed on this issue .
Work with Congress to pass a federal statute creating a clear federal domestic terrorism offense , and provide for appropriately harsh punishment .
3 . Would you sign an agreement with North Korea that entailed partial sanctions relief in exchange for some dismantling of its nuclear weapons program but not full denuclearization ?
Thirty states have enacted no - excuse absentee voting , which allows citizens to submit their votes by mail at designated polling locations . 15 This allows states to save millions of dollars because they don ' t need to establish polling places or pay polling staff , and it increases voter turnout of younger , older , poorer , and minority voters .

Provisional ballots are supposed to act as fail - safe ballots when voters run into problems at the polls , but many of them are not counted . Over 220 , 000 provisional ballots were discounted in the 2016 presidential primaries . State variation of voter eligibility requirements can determine whether or not 100 or 100 , 000 provisional ballots are rejected . In the 2016 presidential primaries in Maricopa County , Arizona , 24 , 630 provisional ballots were rejected because voters were not registered with a political party . 21 These ballots are the final votes counted before determining the outcome of an election . Unclear state directives about how to count provisional ballots should not be the cause of the unfair disqualification of thousands of votes .
so we just touched down in Virginia because you all are about to pick up the baton you ' ve got this incredibly important election day tomorrow in Virginia Virginia is on the precipice Virginia is going very very purple and with just a bit of a push I think Virginia is going to go blue what do you do maybe man yang Yang blue
This threat is not hypothetical . In the recent past , internet - connected machines have been hacked and used to print out fraudulent ballots . 28 Additionally , Russia was able to hack into voter databases across the US . 29 Ballot security is national security , and we must ensure that Russia and others who wish to do us harm do not have an open door into the machinery of democracy . To prevent successful attacks , new machines should be disconnected from the internet .
Adopt a 21 st century approach to regulation that increases the knowledge and capacity of government while using new metrics to determine competitiveness and quickly identifies emerging tech in need of regulation .

These violent acts represent only a small subset of this toxic ideology . Some polls have found almost 10 % of Americans believe it ' s acceptable to hold neo - Nazi beliefs . According to the Anti - Defamation League , both the volume of propaganda being spread by white nationalist groups and the number of public demonstrations have increased over the past several years . Some experts have pegged the number of white nationalists active in the community in the hundreds of thousands .

We must move to a system that draws district lines independently , without the input of politically motivated actors . This is essential in ensuring that minority parties don ' t hold onto power by changing the rules of the game .

Somewhere between 7 and 8 % of the US population has served in the military . These brave individuals took on the sacred duty of protecting our democracy and making the world a safer place . The debt we owe to everyone who took on this responsibility  ' especially those who sacrificed their lives  ' cannot be repaid .
Grocery shopping and nutrition , cooking , and creating and sticking to a personal schedule ( without the regimented schedule enforced by the military )
reason why Donald Trump won is that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs that were in Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania Missouri Wisconsin and Iowa where I just left and when a factory closes blue goes to red in an awful hurry there ' s a straight line up between the adoption of industrial automation and a voting area and their movement to trump and unfortunately
Applying 20 th century solutions to 21 st century problems is not the right way to go . Measures such as breaking up big tech companies to foster competition wouldn ' t necessarily address the fundamental problems . Breaking up Google into 5 mini - Googles wouldn ' t change much as people don ' t want to use the fourth best search engine . Network effects would eventually turn out a dominant player . That ' s why we are taking a modern approach .
Those who have worked within the industry describe the work they ' ve done in stark terms . They say that the smartest minds of a generation are spending their time getting teenagers to click on ads and obsess over social media posts .
As President , I will '
The first thing we need to recognize is that providing for the health of our veterans is a moral imperative , and we need to fully fund a system that works to maximize veteran health .
Work with Congress to pass limitations on lobbying after leaving Congress .
This amounts to $ 23 + billion nationwide per election , allowing the will of the people to out - fund the $ 6 . 5 billion spent on federal races in 2016 , $ 1 . 6 billion of which was Dark Money .

We also must recognize that China is heavily investing in African infrastructure and technology , oftentimes exploiting natural resources with no tangible benefit for the local communities . We need to outcompete China in technological advancement , economic growth , and in the establishment of sustainable social and environmental practices . We need to restructure our trade agreements to offer attractive investment opportunity and to expand markets : by going beyond manufacturing and goods to include services , intellectual property , fair labor practices , and sustainable environment standards .
Creating a resume and finding job opportunities
We first need to amend the Voting Rights Act Section 4 ( b ) to require states to receive permission from the Department of Justice before changing certain voting laws , and then I would direct the Department of Justice to bring suits against restrictive laws .

Gun violence is a scourge in this country . Nearly 40 , 000 Americans die every year to gun violence : 24 , 000 from suicide and 15 , 000 from homicide . After the tragedies in El Paso and Dayton , there have been 255 mass shootings in 2019  ' more than days have passed in the year . Our children are twice as likely to die from gun violence than cancer .
Finally , we need to ensure that prisons have the resources necessary to combat white nationalist gangs , and provide services to individuals who are looking to leave these organizations and , upon release , rebuild their lives outside of the white nationalist community .
Ensure that vote by mail programs specifically target PWD voters .
By providing a model and engaging in international work to help developing nations , we can show the world a better way to engage in governing their nations . We should help developing nations to liberalize , and work with them to diversify their economies . Trade and exporting US technologies to these countries can help us build alliances throughout the world as more countries modernize and liberalize .
Strengthen American Families and School Systems
Ending Partisan Gerrymandering
Improving our Political Rhetoric
Voting is a pillar of our democracy that has helped keep our government accountable for hundreds of years . As generations of activists fought and died to protect and expand the right to vote , we won ourselves a more inclusive and representative government . We all know about Dr . Martin Luther King Jr .  ' s marches in Washington D . C . and Selma , Alabama during the civil rights movement , and we all learn about the suffragettes and the 19 th Amendment in school . Yet , today in the 21 st century , voter access remains a challenge in our democracy . Because , while all Americans have the right to vote , the reality is that many are consistently prevented from doing so . This must change .
4 . What , if any , steps would you take to counter Russian aggression against Ukraine ?
As President , I will :
Limit last minute changes of polling stations to only situations of true exigent circumstances .
present to you all and all of our fellow Americans every year at the State of the Union coin duck I ' m kind of old school I still use popcorn said it was crazy if you like the idea of a president presenting that information to at the State of the Union every year yes then you ' re definitely yeah
Until that transition , there are still many ways we can improve treatment for our veterans , starting with easing the transition from TRICARE to the VA system through improved administration and enrollment .
Climate change is an existential threat , and we need to recognize that we ' re already living through the negative effects . The increase in natural disasters is costing us hundreds of billions of dollars , and the total cost of climate change will run into the trillions while taking an untold number of lives . And the people who are most affected by these impacts of climate change are the least able to deal with it  ' economically disadvantaged and minority communities face a disproportionate burden .

Pass a Term Limits bill to make it harder for lobbyists to develop long - standing relationships with Congress Members that prevent new ideas or legislation from passing .
Once in that system , we need to focus on increasing options and improving access , especially in rural areas , without succumbing to calls to privatize the program .
Implement the American Exchange Program to allow all high school students to experience different areas of the country and form friendships with a diverse group of Americans .
Social media platforms have catalyzed mass disinformation campaigns over the past decade , threatening not just our wellbeing but our democracy . Despite efforts by the tech companies themselves to combat internet disinformation , political disinformation campaigns have reached over 70 countries .

Require the publication in a conspicuous location of how purchases and data is being used to target the individual with other advertisements .
But we must try . And we must do much better than we ' re doing now .
Regulate mechanisms in video games that allow people to  ' gamble ' on random items that are purchased with real money to prevent over - purchasing by minors and to increase transparency in what is being received and the value of it .
Gun violence is a symptom of many underlying diseases . As a people , we need to come together , recognize all causes of gun violence , and implement policies that will combat this scourge .
Like the rest of America ' s infrastructure , voting is chronically underfunded . This leaves our democracy open to attack . My administration will fund the development and rollout of new , more secure machines that aren ' t open to attack .
We can do better , and under my administration we will , by implementing ranked - choice voting . Ranked - choice voting allows each voter to rank their top three candidates , from 1 to 3 . After this is complete , every voter ' s first choice is tallied . If one candidate received over 50 % of the vote , they win the election . If no candidate hits the majority threshold , the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated . Then , everyone who listed that eliminated candidate as their first choice has their second choice considered , a process which continues until someone breaks 50 %.
Call out white nationalism wherever it arises .

Regulate the use of data and privacy by establishing data as a property right . The associated rights will enable individuals to retain ownership and share in the economic value generated by their data .
Treatment doesn ' t work if its not sought out . 80 % of veterans cite embarrassment or shame as a barrier to asking for mental health treatment . We need to combat this by destigmatizing veteran treatment . It can start with an initiative to identify high - ranking veterans who received mental health treatment to speak to these issues publicly , and it can continue with information provided during the Reverse Boot Camp .
It ' s important to note that there are differences in chronic and situational veteran homelessness . Improving stability and employment will help primarily with situational homelessness , while chronic homelessness is usually related to health / mental health issues .
Data generated by each individual needs to be owned by them , with certain rights conveyed that will allow them to know how it ' s used and protect it . These rights include :
Implement a paid family leave policy to ensure that all new parents have time to spend with their children .

emails all mixed together but I believe many of you know different I ' m a numbers guy and the reason why Donald Trump is our president the reason why he won your state by eight points is that we blasted away 40 , 000 manufacturing jobs right here in Iowa and you saw all of those towns go from blue to red as it happened and that did not just happen here in Iowa we did it in Michigan Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Missouri all of

Early voting and mail - in ballots contribute to the convenience and participation of citizens in the democratic process . We need to extend these opportunities to all Americans and do away with restrictions , like name and signature matching requirements , that work against it .
As President , I will :
Direct the DOJ to prohibit all voter ID laws that disenfranchise underrepresented communities .
The federal government can do much more to establish greater support for Native American voting rights . As part of establishing laws to combat voter suppression tactics like voter ID laws and limited polling locations , we need to pass legislation like the Native American Voting Rights Act 23 that carves out specific provisions that address Native American and Alaska Native voting issues . These specifics need to include requiring polling stations to be located near reservations , states to accept tribal ID cards for voting purposes , and alternative address options for those who reside on reservations .
Consider ways to alter the makeup of the Supreme Court if they refuse to allow common sense gun legislation to be enacted , including implementing term limits .
The simplest way to do this is to provide Americans with vouchers they can donate to political campaigns . Every American should get $ 100 a year to give to candidates in federal , state , or local races ; use it or lose it . These Democracy Dollars would , by the sheer volume of the US population , drown out the influence of mega - donors .
Americans are rightfully worried that casting a ballot doesn ' t matter , because powerful special interests and poorly drawn district lines will minimize their voice . When citizens do vote , they ' re hesitant to pick the candidates that actually represent their interests , because they ' re  ' throwing their vote away ' on someone who isn ' t likely to win .

the aftermath of losing these manufacturing jobs that only less than 10 percent of manufacturing workers qualified for federally funded retraining programs and if they did participate the success rate was less than 20 percent we know that almost half of manufacturing workers that lost their jobs left the workforce and did not work again and that nearly 1 / 4 of manufacturing jobs that lost their jobs left the workforce and never worked

Prioritize all initiatives to expand and restore voting rights in the U . S . to the previously and currently incarcerated .
However , we have to continue our involvement in order to ensure that the rights of individuals - in particular , women and young girls - are protected , and that terrorist organizations can ' t reform and organize within the borders . We can do this through helping the country to diversify its economy and maintaining diplomatic ties .
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 14 absolves platforms from all responsibility for any content published on them . However , given the role of recommendation algorithms ' which push negative , polarizing , and false content to maximize engagement ' there needs to be some accountability .
Establish rules and standards around kid - targeted content to protect them from extreme or inappropriate content .
These heroes protect and serve us during their tenure , but they come home to a quick thank you and an economy that isn ' t set up to help them succeed . We owe them more than a handshake .
What we measure matters . If we ' re only getting input from those who are able to vote , we ' re ignoring the needs of the over one hundred million Americans who didn ' t make it to the ballot box . To build a better democracy , we need reform .
The scientific evidence that certain controlled substances  ' particularly marijuana  ' are particularly effective at treating certain ailments common to veterans ( e . g ., PTSD ) and for pain management .
Non - profit organizations are much better equipped to do the work of reaching out to individuals who are trying to leave the white nationalist community . Life After Hate and Free Radicals are two such groups . I spoke with Christian Picciolini about the work he ' s done on this front and the successes he ' s had . We need to expand the work done by individuals like him .
for many of your friends and neighbors and we can change that we can give Americans a raise so that so many of you might think wow that sounds phenomenal too good to be true but I want to give you some background in history a law almost exactly like this past the of Representatives in 1971 under Richard Nixon Martin Luther King was for it a thousand economists signed a letter saying this would be great for the economy and society and a plan just like

Studies show that allowing younger people to vote has positive impacts on overall voting habits . 25 Localities that have lowered the voting age have seen an increase in voter turnout across all age groups . Other studies have shown that delaying when a person first votes ( because of birth dates and election cycles ) decreases the likelihood that they will become a regular voter .

The application and payment system needs to be modernized and streamlined so that our veterans don ' t need to jump through additional hoops in order to use their GI Bill . Approvals should be on entire courses of study instead of on a semester - by - semester basis , thus making it easier and less stressful to continue at an institution .

disease where everything revolves around the almighty dollar in this country and it ' s turning us all into these rats in a maze we ' re like scrambling around trying to justify our own market value and it is time to dispel this confusion in America that economic value and human value are the same things and this is what the traitors against each other in destroy us because in the era of artificial intelligence it doesn ' t matter if the trucker was hardworking
It is the government ' s job to do everything in its power to expand the electorate and foster participation in the democratic process . We need to not only stop current voter suppression tactics , but we also need to recognize how voting laws might disproportionately impact specific communities . By recognizing these effects , we can enact specific initiatives that ensure participation and expand voting access for all .
