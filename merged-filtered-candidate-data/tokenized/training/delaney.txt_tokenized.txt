My vision for the country is based on my own American Dream . I was raised in a blue - collar family ; my dad was a union electrician , and my parents didn ’ t attend college . Because of a great education and a helping hand from others , I was fortunate enough to become a successful entrepreneur . Before age 40 , I founded and led as chief executive two publicly traded companies that created thousands of jobs and were admired in the community . I ’ ve been blessed with a great family and the opportunity to give back through philanthropy and public service . As a progressive businessman , I ’ ve made it a priority to be solutions - oriented and have been consistently recognized as one of the most innovative and bipartisan members of Congress . I ’ ve done this by simultaneously celebrating the power of our free - market economy while insisting that there is a role for government to set goals and rules of the road and take care of those who are left behind .
to elect a president who ' s committed to combating climate change to reforming our broken immigration system to investing in all communities including rural America and we ' re dealing with all of the change that ' s coming from technology but most importantly we need a president who is committed to creating universal health care in the United States of America where everyone gets health care as a basic right of citizenship no Americans should be

to win you know in 1958 John F Kennedy looked out at the American people and said we shouldn ' t seek the Republican answer we shouldn ' t seek the Democratic answer we should seek the right answer and he was right then and he ' s right today he is right today and this is the calling of the Democratic Party to become the party that the American people so desperately are looking for a party that conducts itself with honor and dignity

French President Emmanuel Macron ’ s recent visit to Washington highlighted how differently our two nations are thinking about the future . In March , the French government unveiled a national strategy for artificial intelligence technology that has a clear goal : make France a global leader in AI . In the last year , China and the European Union have taken similar steps . If we ’ re serious about having a prosperous economy for decades to come , the United States should do the same .
questions the first question is what candidate can beat Donald Trump because we got to send that reckless lawless dishonorable human being out of the White House as soon as possible but to do that we need a candidate that has an economic vision that excites every American whether you ' re in a city or in a rural community and I ' ve been to all 99 counties so I know what their people are talking about you got to put forth a candidate who ' s got real solutions to

As President , I will lead the United States in a new direction . America will lead , not alienate . America will move forward , not inward . America will protect the homeland and defend its people and interests at home and abroad . This is an America that acts responsibly – yes responsibly is the keyword – in leading not only our country but also the global community .
Let me start by introducing myself . I am the beneficiary of an America that worked – an immigration system that worked , a social compact that worked , and a miraculous American innovation machine that worked . All of which were created by responsible American leadership .
I ’ ve been blessed to have lived the American Dream . But I worry that stories like mine are out of reach for the next generation . In fact , today ’ s young people could be the first generation of Americans that won ’ t do better than their parents . And that is a failure of leadership . In many ways , the failure to reform our own economic system has led to our current misguided approach to foreign policy .

Africa ’ s expected population boom will bring new challenges and opportunities to the continent . With half of the population in sub - Saharan Africa expected to be under 21 years old by 2035 , there will be a need to create educational and job opportunities for the young population . If jobs are not created , a rise in unemployment could lead to social and political instability and increase the chance of unrest .
“ The Price of Greatness is Responsibility ”
France ’ s national strategy also reveals that Macron ’ s government is wrestling with how to ensure that AI supports inclusivity and diversity , and to make certain that its implementation is transparent . The French aren ’ t just theorizing ; they ’ re taking action . France plans to invest 1 . 5 billion euros ( almost $ 1 . 8 billion dollars ) in the next five years in artificial intelligence research . The French are looking to create their own AI ecosystem , train the next generation of scientists and engineers , and make sure that their workforce is prepared for an automated future .
Second , reassure NATO allies of our commitment to Article 5 , the alliance and its anti - terrorism mission . Russia has defined itself as an adversary of the West . Russia continues its efforts to weaken NATO and its members by subversion . This cannot be tolerated . We must counter these actions aggressively .
We know that the U . S . can respond to the call for unity and cooperation because we ’ ve done it before . In 1958 , then Senator John F . Kennedy spoke in Baltimore shortly after the Soviets had successfully launched Sputnik . Kennedy said , “ let us not despair but act . Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer .”

But this progress has come with challenges , including disrupting our economy and economies in the developed west . The last several decades have seen extraordinary concentration of opportunity , wealth and income making America , in many ways , a country of birthright and not opportunity . As an example of how profound the opportunity concentration is , last year , 80 % of the venture capital was invested in 50 counties in our country – out of nearly 3 , 100 . That story does not end well .

but what we also need to do is roll up our sleeves and get things done get things done that matter to hardworking Americans you know my dad was an electrician he worked with his hands every day we didn ' t have any complicated political discussions at the dinner table except for one thing that my bag told me a thousand times he said if you care about workers you vote for the Democrats that was our pudding
my plan for universal health care but it preserves choice I think we need massive investments in our country in infrastructure and in basic research which was why I ' m proposing the largest investment in infrastructure and research that we ' ve had since the building of the national highway system and the creation of NASA I think we need real solutions to the big issues we face as a nation and not only is that the right way to govern it ' s the right way
Righting the ship will take work , but with responsible leadership , it is not only achievable but inevitable . The world is yearning for responsible U . S . leadership .
This is a responsible vision . And by being responsible at home and in the world , America will prosper .
My family settled in the New York area and ended up in North Jersey . My grandfather worked in a pencil factory . We grew up a blue - collar family in a blue - collar neighborhood . My dad was a union electrician . Our family had health care because of his union and a scholarship from the IBEW helped me go to college . Something my parents never had the opportunity to do .
To close , I want to share with you my core foreign policy priorities my administration will have on day one . After all , leading is fundamentally about choosing and setting priorities . While these are not in any particular order , together they lay out a responsible agenda .
These forces have connected people in ways we could never have imagined . They have worked together to create the greatest poverty elimination machine the world has ever seen . Anyone who thinks the condition of humankind has not fundamentally improved across the last 75 years is simply not looking at the facts . In 1950 , only 25 % of the world was interconnected globally and the global poverty rate was 66 %. Today , these forces have led to 75 % of the world becoming interconnected and the global poverty rate has fallen to 10 %.
I am honored by the invitation to address this remarkable institution , as SAIS celebrates the 75 th anniversary of its founding . Seventy - five years ago , the world was still embroiled in World War II . Here , at home , food rationing was being introduced . Race riots convulsed cities around the country . Despite turmoil both at home and abroad , Christian Herter and Paul Nitze had the foresight to establish SAIS . Their aim at the time was to ensure young Americans were prepared for a post - war world in which the United States would inevitably play a significant role .
Despite our current tense relations with Moscow and Beijing , I am calling for candid discussions with both governments . We must try to resolve points of friction or otherwise minimizing issues that have the potential to become triggers for conflict . In the case of Russia , I believe that an adversarial relationship goes against the long - term interests of both countries . Given the demographic and economic challenges Russia faces , it would benefit in the long term from close economic cooperation and friendly relations with the West . But I will make it clear that this can never happen while they interfere in our elections and those of our allies .

at the condition of hardworking Americans and said we ' re going to do tax policy that helps you and doubled the Earned Income Tax Credit and raise the minimum wage and created that paid family leave these are the kind of things to do if you put the worker at the center of your agenda a responsible nation would have built infrastructure trillions of dollars of infrastructure that there ' s so many of our communities need we would have done that a long time

As President , I will be committed to building a foundation for our country ’ s long - term prosperity . We will invest in education , research and development , cutting - edge technologies , infrastructure , vocational training , and workforce development . I will unleash a moon - shot project in innovation in clean energy technologies , negative emission technologies , and carbon capture and transmission . These will be built in America ’ s heartland , bringing enormous economic growth to struggling communities . And we will restore our country ’ s long - term fiscal health .
Similarly , we have to change our approach to dealing with China ’ s emergence as a global power . We need to initiate a serious discussion with China about the points of friction that have a very real potential to provoke conflict between our two countries . We must explore whether our differences can be negotiated successfully , or mitigated so as to avoid an unthinkable escalation between two giants . Any responsible conversation with China has to focus on China ’ s widespread and systematic program of intellectual property theft that has hurt our economy . China has become our rival by doing three things – they made smart investments , they worked hard but they didn ’ t play by the rules . We cannot allow them to not play by the rules during this next wave of transformative innovation . I will organize a new effort among our allies to hold China accountable . But I will also hold the U . S . private sector accountable . We have laws that prohibit U . S . executives from making payments to foreign leaders . Shouldn ’ t the same laws prevent them from depositing government funded intellectual property into joint ventures with Chinese companies knowing full well they will be stolen and misappropriated ?
honest work and when you do honest work you get a building that works you flip on a switch the lights go on you turn a faucet the water comes out one of the many problems with our president is he doesn ' t build anything he doesn ' t care if anything works he only cares about himself we need to ensure that America works for hardworking Americans we we do we need to elect a president who ' s committed to investing and improving public education in this country we need

all the stuff we talked about all the stuff we read about has caused so many of our country to be left behind and we didn ' t do the basic things we should have done a long time ago to prepare that for this world and invest in them and invest in their communities and that was our failure a responsible nation would have created a universal health care system a long time ago absolutely that ' s what a responsible nation a responsible nation would have looked
It could mean a dismantling of the global security architecture created and led by the United States that has largely maintained peace and prosperity for us and our allies since the end of World War II .
Before we get into specifics , let me briefly share with you some actions I will take . These actions indicate how I think about the world . I view these as responsible actions :
The American people are far greater than the sum of our political parties . It is time for us to rise above our broken politics and renew the spirit that enabled us to achieve the seemingly impossible . This is why I am running for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States .
leadership badly at this moment in time we need to re - establish our leadership role around the world we need a leader who ' s committed to finding common ground and getting things done that matter to hardworking Americans at their kitchen table and you know what we need more than anything we need an individual who will restore decency and honor to the office of the presidency and I stand before you Iowa because I believe on the right answer to those two

Creates a nationwide sense of service and patriotism
My friends , the United States is facing a stunning number of serious challenges in the world today . As Churchill said in that very same speech declaring the need for responsible leadership , “ The people of the United States cannot escape world responsibility .” Russia seeks a reduction of our role in Europe and China wants to supplant us in Asia .
It is up to the people of Venezuela to decide who will lead their government . I support the elevation of Juan Guaidó to president following the Venezuelan constitution and will continue to speak out in favor of his leadership . I would not , however , favor any direct intervention in Venezuelan power struggles by the United States , but do support our approach to sanctions . I would provide substantial humanitarian support via USAID and through our participation in multilateral agencies such as the OAS and InterAmerican Development Bank .
My vision reaffirms support for our security alliances and supporting relations with allies . I will make it clear to friend and foe that the United States stands by its security commitments .
The early years of this great school coincided with the shaping of the post - war so - called ‘ liberal international order .’ Today , that order is under stress . Resurgent nationalism and populism are questioning the core principles of this framework . Revisionist powers are working to undermine the authority of its rules .
And it could mean environmental disaster should the U . S . continue to remain a bystander in the face of climate change .

My vision includes a robust foreign aid program to support global poverty reduction initiatives and to help enhance food security , education , health and women ’ s rights across the globe , with a particular focus on Africa and South Asia .

It is impossible to predict what agreements could be in the best interests of our national security , and that of our allies , short of a full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . As president , I will always consider options that best serve our national security interest . Negotiations with North Korea seeking to achieve nuclear disarmament have been one of the most challenging issues facing successive U . S . administrations for decades . Progress will be incremental , and we need to be patient yet firm in our approach to this relationship . Direct negotiations with North Korea are essential to achieving agreement on the important issues surrounding nuclear disarmament and normalizing relations . While we must be clear that our ultimate objective will be full denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , we should be willing to accept a meaningful and verifiable agreement that takes steps towards denuclearization . We must make clear the path towards our ultimate goal and be steadfast in demanding verified progress before we roll back sanctions . I fear the Trump Administration may agree to removing sanctions against empty measures on the part of North Korea .
I will call for a new Authorization for Military Force
thank you thank you for that nice introduction it ' s really great to be with you here this weekend and you see so many great Democrats in one room ready to go ready to fight ready to win right all right so let ' s I stand before you as someone who has lived the American dream and I ' m so grateful for the opportunities this is this amazing country has given me it gave me the opportunity to learn and get a great education and be the first of my family
Reducing new carbon emissions and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not be enough to limit global warming . According to the IPCC , to achieve net zero emissions and prevent warming in excess of 1 . 5 ° C we will need Negative Emissions Technology , including direct air capture , to remove a minimum of 100 Gt of CO 2 from the atmosphere . This technology is currently too expensive to be implemented at the necessary scale , which is why Delaney proposes ending the federal government ’ s fossil fuel subsidies and making an annual $ 5 billion investment in NET .

For decades , the U . S . has worked to build an unmatched portfolio of allies – no other country in the world has anything like it . Our allies are foundational to our ability to operate around the world militarily , diplomatically and economically . They were built not solely out of friendship , but for our own self - interest . Today , based on irresponsible behavior by U . S . leaders , our allies are losing faith in our relationship and our actions are empowering our adversaries .
in the Congress of the United States and fight for kids like myself who grew up in working families I need a shot need an opportunity and most importantly the opportunity to be blessed with an amazing family happily married for 29 years and four daughters that I ' m so proud but my story is just getting so much harder these days young people today will be the first generation of Americans that don ' t actually do better
The assassination of Jamal Khashoggi was an atrocious act and should cause a reset in our overall relationship with Saudi Arabia . I would demand a clearer accounting than what we have received to date from the Saudi government . While I would not completely cut ties and would continue to do essential business with the country , I would not receive any Saudi official in the White House , and I would not extend high - level U . S . official visits to Saudi Arabia . I would impress upon Saudi officials the importance of respecting human rights at home and abroad . Additionally , I support ending U . S . military support to Saudi Arabia for the purpose of carrying out their military operations in Yemen . My approach to foreign policy will include protection of journalists , wherever they may serve .
stopped doing the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for the future I stand before you here today as someone who does not believe that what hardworking Americans need is more ideology more gridlock or more partisanship they need solutions and maybe that ' s because of where I ' m from they do maybe that ' s because where I ' m from my dad was a union electrician he IBEW he wired buildings for a living he did
I will rejoin the Trans - Pacific Partnership
Churchill ’ s words ring as true today as they did over 70 years ago . As a great nation , we must be a responsible nation . As leaders , we have a responsibility to tell the truth . To lead . To find common ground . To tackle problems and to engage in the world . If political leaders instead shirk these responsibilities – and engage in irresponsible behavior – our country suffers as does the world . This is what I am here to talk about today : responsible U . S . leadership .
I am running for President to offer my fellow Americans and the world something different – something strong and bold , something based on a deep understanding of the most important trends shaping our world , something that will reestablish the United States ’ position as the leader of the international order . I am running to offer my country a responsible approach to the challenges and opportunities we face .

It ’ s therefore striking that the United States doesn ’ t have a national artificial intelligence plan . Despite the recent private meeting with tech executives at the White House , the administration has taken little action in this area .
Climate Corps
That is what responsible leaders do .
Herter and Nitze were men of great vision in world affairs – they served presidents of both parties , and were among a select group of wise leaders who conceived and enacted many of our nation ’ s major national security decisions in the second half of the 20 th century . I can think of no better audience than the SAIS community with whom to engage in a conversation about the international challenges the United States faces in the 21 st century and the foreign affairs vision I have for our country .
Seventh , lead the fight against global warming . I will resume U . S . participation in the Paris Climate Agreement , and I pledge that my Administration will harness American ingenuity and international leadership to save our planet from irreversible effects of global warming . I believe that by implementing a carbon tax , investing in green energy research and unleashing the power of negative emissions technologies , the United States can help save the world from the catastrophic effects of climate change . This is a problem that in many ways only old - fashioned U . S . led innovation can solve and if we do it , we will have the added benefit of owning the most valuable technology in the world .
That ’ s why last year I joined with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House and Senate in introducing the Future of AI Act , the first bill of its kind to be introduced in Congress . The bill looks at some of the same key questions that the French have examined , because when you zoom out it is clear that these concerns are universal : How can we make sure that workers and society will benefit ? How can we encourage and support economy - boosting and job - creating research ? And how can we ensure that AI will be implemented ethically and without bias , while also protecting user privacy ?
The United States should take a leading role in demanding Russia ’ s return to its established borders . I would provide leadership within NATO to deliver a unified message to Moscow that such aggression will not be tolerated . I would engage with elected Ukrainian leaders to support their efforts to push Russia back , including military aide , training and support as appropriate . Russian aggression against Ukraine has become a lost issue since the beginning of the Trump Administration . President Putin has led Russia with an antagonistic and predatory foreign policy , including the invasion into the Ukraine and annexation of Crimea , which are unacceptable . I would not walk away from this challenge as the Trump Administration has done . I would also pursue targeted sanctions against Russian interests to drive this point home .
My vision revives arms control negotiations , putting them high on the national security agenda .
As populations grow in the developing world , it is easiest to turn to cheap , dirty energy sources to meet increasing energy needs . Developing countries often don ’ t have the luxury of choosing more expensive , but cleaner , energy sources and greener infrastructure . This is where U . S . global leadership is so incredibly important . There are several policies that the U . S . can lead on to support global renewable energy efforts and many of them center on a key U . S . advantage – innovation which is why I have called for a five - fold increase in Department of Energy basic research to unleash the potential in our scientific community . We must continue to invest in renewable energy sources that can be built and operated for cheaper costs to make these energy sources more economically viable around the world . Additionally , we must invest in direct air capture and negative emissions technologies which suck carbon out of the atmosphere like a vacuum . The UNIPCC report stated that if we want to meet the global emissions reductions goals , we must invest in technology to remove carbon from the atmosphere . The U . S . can become a leader in advancing and exporting this technology for it to be used more widely and at a cheaper cost . The U . S . withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement , which was the first global effort where almost all countries around the world committed to addressing climate change , was a mistake . As president , I would rejoin the Paris Agreement on day one .
Provide information and support to families about sustainability , energy efficiency , and renewable energy
I would seek to reenter the TPP on day one of my administration . In response to the emergence of China as a dominant economic power on the international stage – which does not always adhere to accepted trade and economic norms and rules – 12 leading Pacific Rim countries reached agreement on a set of protocols for a rules - based trade deal covering 40 % of the global economy to counter Chinese economic misconduct . I was one of a handful of Democrats who voted in favor of Trade Promotion Authority to give President Obama the ability to effectively negotiate TPP because I felt we needed a strong strategic response to China . I believed that the United States alone could not stand against China , that it would take a multilateral and strategic effort to counter China . The Trump Administration has abandoned this approach in favor of a trade war with China , a trade war that has had a serious negative impact on hard working Americans and several sectors of the United States economy .
I am the grandson of immigrants . Two of my grandparents were born abroad , in England and Ireland . One of them , my grandfather Al Rowe , immigrated to the United States in 1923 . He landed at Ellis Island as a teenager , with his seven brothers and sisters . While each of his brothers and sisters were allowed into the country , he was detained because he had a disability . He only had one arm . He appealed his deportation , and as fate would have it , his case was heard by a judge who also only had one arm . You can guess how his appeal went .
I will develop a new aid and stabilization plan for Central America that will stem the flow of migrants and asylum - seekers to our borders
To implement infrastructure apprenticeships , all federal contractors would be required to design and implement an apprentice program
We will solve climate change the American way , innovating our way out of the problem . This will require continued robust government support . Delaney proposes a 5 - fold increase in DOE green energy programs , including the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy , the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy , and the Office of Nuclear Energy . This investment will support research to improve energy storage , battery performance , sustainable transportation technology , grid efficiency , renewable energy , energy efficiency , carbon capture , advanced nuclear , and energy conservation technology .
My vision ends the era of ill - advised wars of choice that do not advance our vital national interests . Our ability to prevent war depends to a great extent on the perception of our adversaries that we would defeat them in any conflict .
Sixth , pursue a get - tough approach with China that aims to eliminate Chinese theft of U . S . technology and intellectual property and unfair barriers to American exports and investment . China acts like pirates . Trump ’ s trade war , however , is proving extremely costly to American producers , workers , and consumers , and I greatly fear that he will settle for short - term Chinese concessions in exchange for surrendering the high ground on technology . We need to negotiate with China from a position of strength , and that means ending trade wars with our closest friends and allies so that we can join forces in confronting Beijing . It also means rejoining the TPP .
The government would enter into public / private partnerships with private companies and trade unions to offer infrastructure apprenticeships
Every American will complete a minimum of 1 year and a maximum of 2 years of mandatory
Reducing emissions from agriculture
To do this , we need new infrastructure , which can be paid for using my bipartisan approach to infrastructure and international tax reform . We need to be smarter , fueled by more investment in science , education and research . We need new ideas on the future of jobs and work , one where we build a stronger and more vibrant middle class . We need to encourage a more just and inclusive form of capitalism and reduce barriers to small - business formation , start - ups , job creation , investment and growth . We need to strengthen our safety - net programs and create a new social contract . We need to reform the systems of education , health care and immigration , and encourage more volunteerism , impact investing and public service . And we need to take affirmative steps to reduce our security , fiscal and climate risks . This is what my campaign will be about .
the challenges we face as a nation not impossible promises you got to put forth a candidate who will build a big tent Democratic Party like we did in 2018 when we flipped the House of Representatives by putting forth candidates that progressives and moderates and independents and even disaffected Republicans can get excited about but the second question I think you have to ask yourself is who should lead our country because we need
And in the United States , we are gripped by a growing sense of nationalism , which I believe is the wrong answer to every question we could ask ourselves .
To do this work with the commitment it deserves , I will not be running for reelection to the House of Representatives . No games , no cat - and - mouse , no backup plan at the 11 th hour if a focus group goes badly .

But the current Administration is squandering this advantage by hollowing out the State Department . I will support these patriots and I will restore the tools of statecraft needed to give policymakers options other than war .

I will make clear that we stand once again for our ideals and with our allies

In the face of these changes , U . S . leaders are called to responsibly address our own domestic economic affairs , rebuild the social compact for our citizens , and work with our partners to lead and ensure the security and prosperity of the world . And these two things are linked . In fact , I would argue that what is happening around the world has never been more important to the safety and prosperity of our citizens . In that regard , we ought to be thinking about how to adapt and reform our overall strategy , our forces and security architecture to a changing world and changing international threat environment . Unfortunately , we are lagging in these responsibilities . Many Western democracies are turning inward . Populism is on the rise everywhere .
dollar repatriation issue and our ailing infrastructure which is estimated to be a trillion dollar investment we need to make all the one though it created tens of thousands of jobs it was nonpartisan and very smart on a number of levels and has a support of a lot of members being a progressive means thinking about the future through the lens of people who work who raise families who want their kids to get ahead technology and our global
Another four years of political dysfunction with a complete inability to find common ground and solve some of the basic challenges in our country will undoubtedly continue many of the underlying trends I mentioned and prevent us from addressing the massive debts we are leaving the next generation .

The National Service requirement will apply to individuals born after 2006 , but will phase in
After college , I went to law school and then got into business , starting two companies from scratch . We were able to take those companies public – I was the youngest CEO of a NYSE company – and we were able to hire and employ a lot of people and achieve great success .
2020 : The Stakes Are High

France isn ’ t alone . Last month , the European Union ’ s executive branch recommended its member states increase their public and private sector investment in AI . It also pledged billions in direct research spending . Meanwhile , China laid out its AI plan for global dominance last year , a plan that has also been backed up with massive investment . China ’ s goal is to lead the world in AI technology by 2030 . Around the world , our global economic competitors are taking action on artificial intelligence .
By promoting innovation in NET and implementing the carbon fee , Delaney will create a powerful financial incentive to capture carbon instead of releasing it into the atmosphere . As emitting carbon becomes more expensive due to the increasing carbon fee , it will be more economical to capture the carbon and avoid paying the fee .
The largest component of Delaney ’ s climate plan that will have the biggest impact is his Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal . It is time we put a price on carbon to end polluters ’ free ride . While in Congress , Delaney introduced the first bipartisan Carbon Fee and Dividend bill in over 10 years . The proposal starts the fee at $ 15 per metric ton of CO 2 equivalent and increases the cost by $ 10 each year . Implementing a carbon fee , where the revenue is returned to the American people , is the best method for providing the market incentives to reduce our emissions . Delaney ’ s Carbon Fee will reduce carbon emissions by 90 % by 2050 . Taxpayers would also be given options with what to do with the dividend , including investing in a tax - advantaged savings account like a 529 for future education purposes or a retirement account . The Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal has bipartisan support from various industries in the private sector as well as the environmental community . However , we need more innovative solutions that will get us to net - zero emissions by 2050 .
independents who just want their elected officials to put the country first and even those disaffected Republicans who look at this president and see that he has no moral compass and have turned their back on that party if we become that party we ' re gonna win every election and more importantly we ' ll be able to govern because whether it ' s creating universal health care or dealing with climate change or investing in communities that are left behind or
and we gotta get back to that we got to be the party that puts forth common - sense solutions not impossible promises where we can actually get real things done that matter to the American people like do things to create jobs in every community do things to invest in infrastructure in every community do things that boost wages in every community create a universal healthcare system improve public education so that every kid no matter the condition of
Delaney proposed the creation of the Climate Corps as part of his National Service Program . The new program would provide opportunities for recent high school graduates to work in low - income urban and rural communities where the Corps members would support these communities ’ transition to a green economy , work on environmentally friendly projects , and fight climate change by working on the ground . Under - resourced communities for too long have suffered the most from pollution and climate change , all too often lacking clean water to drink and clean air to breathe . We must provide the manpower and resources to support these communities and recognize that all Americans have a right to a clean , safe , and healthy environment .
Our steady and substantial support for and adherence to multilateralism has been our greatest foreign policy accomplishment since World War II . The United Nations and all its agencies , NATO , the IMF , the World Bank , The Asia Development Bank , the InterAmerican Development Bank , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other multilateral initiatives have all collectively and individually made enormous and crucial contributions to world peace , economic development and poverty alleviation since World War II . The continued financial and political support of the U . S ., in particular the U . S . commitment to the economic model of free enterprise and international engagement , was the most important cornerstone of these multinational efforts .
It is critical that United States foreign policy be based on a solid foundation of moral principles ; that foundation is what has always distinguished the U . S . on the world stage . Within that context , we must place a high priority on defending human rights of all people globally and when confronted with human rights abuses by countries with whom we have relations , we must make the resolution of those abuses an important part of our engagement with that country . There should be no exception to this bedrock foundational policy , not in China , not anywhere and the well documented abuses by the Chinese government that are occurring with respect to the Uighurs demand a U . S . and global response . My administration would work closely with appropriate United Nations agencies – and the U . S . Congress - to investigate human rights abuses which have been committed against the Uighur people . I would place this issue front and center in diplomatic discussions with the Chinese government and would urge them to accord human rights protections to all peoples under their domain . With regard to Hong Kong , while I respect the Chinese government ' s right to govern within its borders , I will voice strong support for Hong Kong ' s right to autonomy awarded to the city by its status as a special administration region . Hong Kong ' s ability to manage its own affairs is important to U . S . policy since thousands of U . S . businesses operate out of Hong Kong because of the economic and political protections .
to go to college it gave me the opportunity to be an entrepreneur and a business builder and create thousands of jobs and get an award from the Obama administration for the work we did in disadvantaged communities right you gotta invest in communities I always used to say business unless someone invests nothing happens and we need more investments in so many communities around this country and I know how to do it the opportunity to serve my country
than their parents think about that the first generation ever we ' re leaving the debts they can ' t repay fiscal bets climate bets we ' re leaving them a world where a half of the American people can ' t afford a five hundred dollar expense where 40 % of hardworking Americans can ' t afford their basic necessities like their rent their food their utilities how did this happen well it ' s really simple the world changed really fast technology and globalization
Yes , I would rejoin , but I would insist on a longer duration . The JCPOA was the best arrangement that six of the leading nations in the world , plus the European Union , could reach to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons . At the time the Trump Administration withdrew from the JCPOA , Iran was in compliance with the terms . U . S . withdrawal has become a provocation for the Iranians to not feel constrained to abide by the JCPOA , which has made the situation with Iran inherently more dangerous . The most significant weakness of the JCPOA was the tenor - it was not long enough in duration to provide hope for a successor Iranian regime to confirm long - term compliance . I would seek a longer term - 20 years - as a condition for rejoining the JCPOA . In addition , I would make clear to the Iranians that , while the JCPOA does not address Iranian ICBM developments or Iranian complicity in terrorist activities , the United States will independently of the nuclear deal take strong measures to respond to any such conduct . Iran is a bad actor , and the JCPOA with a longer duration is an important part of eliminating the threat that Iran can possess a nuclear weapon , a situation that must not be accepted .
To meet the National Service requirement , participants can choose one of four options :
And my vision reinforces global multilateral institutions that establish rules on issues of critical importance to Americans .
My vision makes a commitment to diplomacy as the first resort . Our diplomatic corps can be a powerful force in the world when backed by the world ’ s strongest military .
Another four years of backward orientation , of trying to create a world that doesn ’ t exist anymore and wasn ’ t as good as it is romanticized , won ’ t work , instead we should be focusing on the future and harnessing amazing technological innovation to build a better world .
My approach goes beyond party and partisanship ; I am first and foremost an American . I believe in a common national identity . I love our ambition , our values , what we represent to the world and our ability to use our greatness for a good and noble purpose . It is my love of country that compels me to behave differently in politics — to work to do big things , seek solutions and compromise , respect the privilege of public service and be optimistic about the world .

Community Service would operate similarly to AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps
through the challenge for the larger banks to finance a company like ours John ' s firm was one of the few that stepped up and gave us the credit facility that made sense to us we went from 150 employees back in 2003 to over a thousand employees today and John Delaney helped peel back growth jobs the progressive businessman and building his companies keep always insisted on the highest of ethical standard he treated people with respect
The stakes in the 2020 election thus could not be higher for all Americans , but especially for young Americans whose futures are on the line .
When Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) in September 2001 after the terrorist attacks on September 11 th , the mission was clear in its purpose , to hold accountable those who attacked the United States , and those who harbored the terrorists . Eighteen years later , we are still in Afghanistan , but the mission has since been muddled . Congress needs to pass a new AUMF to update and clarify the mission of U . S . forces . While I support dramatically reducing the number of U . S . troops in Afghanistan , I presently do not believe that a full withdrawal is in our best interests and therefore I envision keeping a small contingency of U . S . forces with a specific focus to train and support local security forces .
It could mean the difference between a truly free world and one where despotic leaders have undue influence .
Climate change skeptics often invoke the false choice of having to choose between jobs or the environment ; we can create jobs AND fight climate change at the same time . That ’ s where the Carbon Throughway comes in .
The 2020 presidential election takes place against the backdrop of significant changes in the world and at home . The global balance of power is shifting before our eyes , with Asia now rivaling the West as the world ’ s center of gravity . New powers are emerging , some posing unique challenges to the United States and the liberal international order . The extraordinary power of technological innovation has transformed everything in our world – economies , jobs , national security and human interaction .
In the areas of national security and foreign policy , I believe the stakes are particularly high .
and they say I can sign up for that plan so unbalanced global trade reshaped and improved our country in the world but it didn ' t help everyone and no one stood up to make sure entire communities were decimated and those hurt more helped the backbone of our country the people who built our nation and save the world were tragically ignored now there ' s another big wave of global change happening technological innovation and automation are reshaping
My approach to international relations is based on preserving the foundational principles that have informed U . S . policy for 75 years , while adapting our strategies to protect our interests in the 21 st century . This means reaffirming and demonstrating who we are and what we stand for – a proud democracy that supports the cause of freedom and human rights .
Thank you very much .
I do support a two - state solution but do not think it should be the position of the U . S . to predetermine what that agreement looks like . The only way that lasting peace can be achieved in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is if there are direct , bilateral negotiations between the two parties . The U . S . president can and should be a facilitator and mediator in helping parties come to an agreement , which we have seen done successfully in the past . To help achieve a successful agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians , the U . S . can work with regional partners including Egypt and Jordan to provide stability in the conflict . This includes providing Israel – one of our most important and enduring allies - with the necessary resources to defend themselves while also providing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population to promote human development and humanitarian services such as education and medical services in ways that reach the people directly .
His name was Al Rowe . He came to this country in 1923
with his seven brothers and sisters into Ellis Island When they arrived , young Al was detained . He wasn ' t let into this country . His seven brothers and sisters were let in but he was detained . And the reason he was detained was because he only had one arm . And back then , in 1923 , we didn ' t let

created jobs with good pay and benefits and always was giving back to the community the Obama administration awarded John ' s company the bank enterprise award for investing in communities that so many banks under serve and ignore that ' s classic John always doing more when I ran for Congress I said back then let ' s stand up for workers instead of big companies or big banks let ' s invest in our country and
Ninth , continue to strengthen our military . A report last year from the National Defense Strategy Commission warned that “ America has reached the point of a full - blown national security crisis .” The report warns of decreased air - superiority , lagging investments in the next generation of weapons systems , and advances made by Russia and China that threaten the United States ’ historically immense comparative advantage . It is imperative that the United States both strategically focus on the weapons needed for the next generation of warfare and get our fiscal house in order so that we can fund them .
The facts clearly favor the optimist .
It could mean a nuclear arms race with Russia and China .
That is what I am offering to my party , and what I hope to offer the country .
Thank you for having me .
I am optimistic about our future . A future where responsible businesses work with our government to lead the world not only in growth and innovation but also in positive societal change .
We all know that we ' re a nation of immigrants . Let me tell my own personal immigration story . It ' s about my grandfather .
their birth it ' s the same educational opportunities as every young person in this country these are the kind of things that have to become the true north of this amazing party of ours and I ' m running for president to be the person who can get those things done things that matter to the American people you know in 1958 John F Kennedy gave a speech when he was a senator and he said we should not seek the Republican answer
I will put arms control at the top of my national security agenda
It is extremely important , however , that Democrats not make the mistake of assuming that all that needs to be done to bolster U . S . security is to reverse the misguided policies and positions of the current Administration . Given fundamental changes in the global system that have been underway since before Trump took office , it is imperative that we also develop new approaches to emerging challenges .
a set of policies that can and should make it possible we allow ourselves to be divided and we let our political debate curate into an us - versus - them we will fall fall short but if we take these challenges head - on the future is ours
meet and work with people from all backgrounds .
I will mobilize all federal resources to mount an effective cyber defense
Another four years of highly divisive politics could lead us to a place where we can no longer discuss our differences in a civil matter or argue from a set of shared truths . It could leave us not fighting together for Team USA , as Ron Chernow warned on Saturday night in front of a room full of journalists .
The difference between my approach to Russia and Donald Trump ’ s is that I believe , as did Ronald Reagan and many of our Cold War leaders , that we can only negotiate successfully with Moscow from a position of significant strength . If we approach Russia from a position of strength – then we can have an honest dialogue about Russia ’ s interests and role in the world . A responsible President is clear - eyed about Russia ’ s motives and tactics , but mindful that dialogue with Russia is always in our self - interest .
Eighth , meet the challenge of cyberwarfare . I will propose the creation of a Department of Cybersecurity to bring all U . S . domestic capabilities under a single roof and develop a unified strategy to protect the homeland under a single chain of command . We need to be prepared to go on the offensive – to carry this fight to adversaries who have come to feel that they can attack us in cyberspace with impunity . While the proposed Department of Cybersecurity will not conduct offensive missions – leaving that to the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community – it will coordinate with those agencies on all aspects of our nation ’ s response to cybersecurity threats . Russia will not be dissuaded from attacking our elections unless we make it too painful for them to do so .
Fourth , address Middle East issues . The Middle East requires the U . S . to remain engaged on issues of concern and we have brave men and women at risk there , and other places in the world , every day . In each such decision I make in the Middle East , there will be clear goals . For example , in Syria we should not reduce forces until we have a clear understanding of how the Kurds will be protected , that the threat of ISIS is eliminated , that the large numbers of ISIS detainees are dealt with properly and that Iran doesn ’ t have a military presence on the Israel border . In Iraq and Afghanistan , our long - term goals are force reduction but accompanied by on - going presence focused on security and anti - terrorism training . I support reviving U . S . participation in the JCPOA . We can leverage our return to the negotiating table to obtain improvements to the deal as well as to address Iran ’ s destabilizing activities in the region and beyond .
over time
awareness about sustainable practices
